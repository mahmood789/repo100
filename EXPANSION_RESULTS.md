# Expansion Results Summary

## Current Status

**Date:** October 20, 2025
**Manifest Lines:** 147 (including header)
**Total Entries:** 146
**Complete Entries:** 141
**Incomplete Entries:** 5

### Breakdown by Source
- **CRAN:** 65 datasets (complete)
- **GitHub:** 76 datasets (complete) + 5 incomplete = 81 total

### Progress Toward Goal
- **Target:** 300 datasets
- **Current:** 141 complete datasets
- **Still Need:** 159 more datasets
- **Progress:** 47% complete

## What Happened

### Step 1: Cleanup
✓ Removed toy datasets from dmetar package
⚠ **Issue:** 5 incomplete GitHub entries remain (with NA values)

### Step 2: Expansion
⚠ **Issue:** Only 3 new CRAN datasets were added (all from dmetar)
- dmetar_DepressionMortality
- dmetar_TherapyFormats
- dmetar_ThirdWave

**Expected:** ~150+ new datasets from 16 packages
**Actual:** Only 3 datasets added

## Issues Identified

### 1. Incomplete Entries (5 datasets)
These have NA values for source_pkg, moderators, etc.:
- meta_Fleiss93
- meta_Fleiss93cont
- metadat_dat.colditz1994
- metadat_dat.lim2014
- netmeta_Senn2013

### 2. Expansion Didn't Run Fully
Possible reasons:
- Script stopped early or errored
- Packages weren't available/installed
- Candidates were filtered out
- User interrupted the script

### 3. Orphaned CSV Files
- 162 CSV files exist
- Only 141 complete manifest entries
- **21 files** are not properly registered

## Next Steps

### Option A: Fix and Re-run Expansion
1. Remove the 5 incomplete entries from manifest
2. Run expansion script again
3. Should add ~150+ datasets from 16 packages

### Option B: Check What Went Wrong
1. Look at R console output from the run
2. Check if there were errors
3. See which packages were actually scanned

### Option C: Manual Investigation
Check which packages are installed and available:
```r
installed.packages()[grep("meta", installed.packages()[,1], ignore.case=TRUE), "Package"]
```

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate: Clean up incomplete entries
```r
source("scripts/cleanup_manifest.R")
```

### Then: Re-run expansion properly
```r
source("scripts/expand_to_300_real.R")
```

**Make sure to watch the R console output this time!**

Look for messages like:
- "Found X potential CRAN datasets"
- "After removing known and toy datasets: X"
- "Need X more datasets"
- Processing messages for each dataset

## File Discrepancies

CSV files exist for:
- metadat_dat.lim2014.csv (original)
- metadat_dat.lim2014_1.csv
- metadat_dat.lim2014_2.csv
- metadat_dat.lim2014_3.csv
- metadat_dat.lim2014_4.csv

But manifest only has one entry for metadat_dat.lim2014 (incomplete).
These variants should be in the manifest as separate entries.
