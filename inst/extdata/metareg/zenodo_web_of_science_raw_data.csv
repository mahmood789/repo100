PM2.5, referring to particles with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 mu m, is the most common form of pollutants triggering disease. To cease these detrimental effects of PM2.5 on our physical fitness, air filters with high efficiency, high stability, and low cost are urgently called for. Herein, we introduce a new kind of nanofiber (PAN/GO) composed of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and graphene oxide (GO) to capture PM pollutants. The nanofibers are synthesized by a simple and versatile electrospinning method. Nanofibrous membranes possess large adsorption capacity, high adsorption efficiency, and excellent long-term removal efficiency for PM2.5. When PAN/GO nanofibers are exposed in an environment where the concentration of PM2.5 reaches similar to 460 mu g m(-3), the PM2.5 removal efficiency can turn out to be 99.6%. After 100 h of adsorption, PAN/GO nanofibers-can still maintain a PM2.5 removal efficiency of 99.1%, showing an excellent and long-term-stable adsorption ability. As-synthesized PAN/GO nanofibers can act as a prominent contender for practical applications as air filtration masks, showing competitive potential in large-scale production and becoming an up-and-coming alternative for air purification media.;""[Zhang, Chaoran; Yao, Lu; Yang, Zhi; Kong, Eric Siu-Wai; Zhang, Yafei] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Elect Informat & Elect Engn, Minist Educ, Key Lab Thin Film & Microfabricat Technol, Dong Chuan Rd 800, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Xiaofeng] Beijing Municipal Inst Labor Protect, Beijing 100054, Peoples R China"";""Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Beijing Municipal Research Institute of Environment"";Zhang, YF (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Elect Informat & Elect Engn, Minist Educ, Key Lab Thin Film & Microfabricat Technol, Dong Chuan Rd 800, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.;yfzhang@sjtu.edu.cn;""Zhang, Yafei/JFA-4731-2023; Yang, Zhi/L-1679-2013; Zhang, Chaoran/AAF-7128-2019; Zhu, Xiaofeng/F-3601-2016"";""Yang, Zhi/0000-0002-0871-5882; Zhang, Chaoran/0000-0002-4707-3333;"";;;;;41;;;;;;;;;;;;;JUN;2019;2;6;;;;;3916;3924;;10.1021/acsanm.9b00806;http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsanm.9b00806;;;;;;;;;;;;;;View Full Record in Web of Science"

Volatilization of weakly adsorbed particles onto quartz filter paper (QFP) limits its performance. The adsorption of particulate matter (PM10) onto QFP coated with different concentrations of graphene oxide (GO) was investigated to enhance the adsorption potential. Hummer's method was adopted to synthesize GO. QFPs were coated with different concentrations of GO using a spin coating technique to optimize the result. The morphology and microstructure of GO-QFP were characterized by various experimental techniques, like XRD, FTIR, EDX, and SEM. GO showed considerable affinity to aerosol particles for GO-QFP weighing 5 mg/ml, whereas adsorption of the coated samples before and after was significantly reduced. The high affinity to aerosol particles was due to dominated pi-pi interactions and the grooved regions formed on the GO layer. It was considered that the high surface to volume ratio of GO-QFP improves the adsorptive property of the QF and consequently enhances the performance of the filter paper.

Etching KMnO4 and Co3O4 nanoparticles embedded on RGO nanosheets obtained the H-RGO nanosheets, followed by ordinary vacuum filtration. The H-RGO nanosheets show abundantly porous features with a rich hole (average pore size of 12.97 nm) on the planar H-RGO nanosheets, which is beneficial to the mass transfer of the as-prepared membrane. Thanks to its porously hierarchical architectures, the H-RGO-based filter shows excellent performance for the capture of PM, e.g., high efficiency of greater than 99 % for PM1.0, PM2.5, PM5.0, and PM10, respectively. Interestingly, the inherent hydrophobicity of H-RGO nanosheets, the as-prepared membrane exhibits superior humidity resistance with a high filtration efficiency of nearly 100 % observed even at high humidity (96 +/- 2 % relative) over a continuous 18-hour test, which is considerably better than hydrophilic filtration materials.

No conclusive understandings have been obtained about the physicochemical determinants in accounting for differential adverse outcomes. Here we compared the cytotoxicity of four carbon black (CB) particles with similar physicochemical properties except for their oxygen contents (C824455 < C1864 < Printex U < SB4A). We found that these four CB particles manifested in vitro and in vivo cytotoxicity reversely related to their oxygen contents, namely a hierarchy of cytotoxicity: C824455 > C1864 > Printex U > SB4A. Among these CB particles, the most significant lung injury (e.g. collapses and inflammation) and macrophagic activation were found for C824455 and C1864, in particular for C824455. All these differences in toxicity profiles, including in vitro and in vivo cytotoxicity, pro-inflammatory effects and direct damages to the lung epithelia, should be (at least partially) ascribed to the oxygen content in these CB particles that in turn determined their transformation, i.e. the different aggregation states. Nonetheless, PM2.5 likewise caused severe in vivo and in vitro toxicities to the lung cells and macrophages. This study thus offers more insights into the structure-activity relationship (SAR) and opens a new avenue to elucidate the physicochemical determinants in evoking lung injuries by ultrafine airborne particles.;""[Wu, Yakun; Guo, Yifan; Song, Haoyang; Liu, Wei; Liu, Sijin] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Environm Chem & Ecotoxicol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yakun; Liu, Wei; Liu, Sijin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yi; Zuo, Yi Y.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Mech Engn, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Liu, Yajun] Peking Univ, Beijing Jishuitan Hosp, Hlth Sci Ctr, Beijing 100035, Peoples R China; [Sang, Nan] Shanxi Univ, Coll Environm & Resource, Res Ctr Environm & Hlth, Taiyuan 030006, Shanxi, Peoples R China"";""Chinese Academy of Sciences; Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences (RCEES), CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Peking University; Shanxi University"";Liu, SJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Environm Chem & Ecotoxicol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China.;sjliu@rcees.ac.cn;""; Liu, Wei/LQJ-6899-2024; Zuo, Yi/B-3177-2013; Guo, Yifan/HMO-8321-2023; Wu, Yakun/L-3663-2018; Liu, Yajun/MVV-3763-2025"";""Wu, Yakun/0000-0002-7320-3357;"";;;;;38;;;;;;;;;;;;;APR 15;2018;150;;;;;;207;214;;10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.12.044;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.12.044;;;;;;;;;;;;;;View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, the realization of fast and high-efficiency PM2.5 filtration under a high gas-velocity condition is still a big challenge for the pure polymer NFM. Herein, we introduce reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets (NSs) into the electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) NFM to enhance both the surface activity and the gas permeability of the composite NFM during air filtration. By combining the experimental results with the theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that the rGO NSs dispersed on/in the PAN NFM remarkably increase the PM2.5 capture sites on the uncross-linked nanofibers based on both hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interaction forces. Furthermore, the tensile strength of the rGO-functionalized PAN NFM (0.48-1.25 MPa) is much higher than that of the pure PAN NFM (0.19 MPa) due to the excellent mechanical properties of the rGO NSs. The enhanced tensile strength of the composite NFM effectively boosts the gas permeability during air filtration. In this way, the optimal NFM containing 2.5 wt% rGO NSs exhibited >99.9% PM2.5 removal efficiency, approximate to 0.094 Pa-1 quality factor, and only approximate to 70 Pa pressure drop for resisting the airflow with a high gas velocity of approximate to 20 L min(-1).;""[Zhang, Peng; Wan, Dongyang; Zhang, Zhenyi; Hu, Junhua; Shao, Guosheng] Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Peng; Wan, Dongyang; Zhang, Zhenyi; Hu, Junhua; Shao, Guosheng] Zhengzhou Univ, State Ctr Int Cooperat Designer Low Carbon & Envi, Zhengzhou 450001, Henan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Peng; Hu, Junhua; Shao, Guosheng] Zhengzhou Mat Genome Inst, Xingyang 450100, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhenyi] Dalian Nationalities Univ, Sch Phys & Mat Engn, Key Lab Photosensit Mat & Devices Liaoning Prov, Key Lab New Energy & Rare Earth Resource Utilizat, 18 Liaohe West Rd, Dalian 116600, Peoples R China; [Wang, Guodong] Dalian Juyang Technol Co Ltd, Dalian 116085, Peoples R China"";""Zhengzhou University; Zhengzhou University; Dalian Minzu University"";""Zhang, ZY (corresponding author), Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China.;Zhang, ZY (corresponding author), Zhengzhou Univ, State Ctr Int Cooperat Designer Low Carbon & Envi, Zhengzhou 450001, Henan, Peoples R China.;Zhang, ZY (corresponding author), Dalian Nationalities Univ, Sch Phys & Mat Engn, Key Lab Photosensit Mat & Devices Liaoning Prov, Key Lab New Energy & Rare Earth Resource Utilizat, 18 Liaohe West Rd, Dalian 116600, Peoples R China."";zhangzy@dlnu.edu.cn;""Shao, Guosheng/C-2143-2016; Wan, Dongyang/B-3409-2013; Zhang, Peng/Y-4108-2018"";""Shao, Guosheng/0000-0003-1498-7929; Zhang, Peng/0000-0001-9505-3858; Hu, Junhua/0000-0003-0191-1503; Zhang, Zhenyi/0000-0003-3606-8966"";;;;;34;;;;;;;;;;;;;AUG 1;2018;5;8;;;;;1813;1820;;10.1039/c8en00468d;http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8en00468d;;;;;;;;;;;;;;View Full Record in Web of Science"

First, a GO-TiO2 composite was synthesized using titanium dioxide loading on GO via 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES). The GO-Y2O3 composite was synthesized using nano-yttrium oxide intercalating into GO through two different silane coupling agents. The GO-SiO2 composite was synthesized via an in-situ two-step sol-gel process utilizing APTES and tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) in an aqueous ethanol solution. The morphology and structure of the GO-metal oxide composites (GO-TiO2, GO-Y2O3 and GO-SiO2) were studied. Subsequently, GO-metal oxides were incorporated into UFP to investigate the composite's effectiveness in corrosion protection of metal substrates. Compared with GO-TiO2/UFP and GO-Y2O3/UFP, GO-SiO2/UFP showed superior alkali-resistance enhancing performance. Additionally, GO crosslinked with APTES-TiO2 via covalent bonds and the well-dispersed GO-TiO2 in UFP improved the electrochemical corrosion properties of the UFP coatings, most likely due to the obstruction of the diffusion pathways inside the UFP coating matrix, thus preventing the diffusion of penetrating species. It was revealed that the corrosion resistance of GO-TiO2/UFP composite coating was noticeably higher than GO-SiO2/UFP and GO-Y2O3/UFP composite coatings.;""[Zhang, Lei; Wu, Haitang; Huang, Xiaohua] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Forestry, Key Lab Exploitat & Utilizat Econ Plant Resources, 3 Taicheng Rd, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lei] Acad Mil Med Sci, Res Inst Chem Def, Beijing 102205, Peoples R China; [Wang, Wupin] Xian Res Inst Chinese Lacquer All China Federat S, Xian 712000, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Zeyu; Wei, Ming] Wuhan Univ Technol, 122 Luo Shi Rd, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China"";""Northwest A&F University - China; Academy of Military Medical Sciences - China; Research Institute of Chemical Defense - China; Wuhan University of Technology"";""Wu, HT; Huang, XH (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Forestry, Key Lab Exploitat & Utilizat Econ Plant Resources, 3 Taicheng Rd, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China."";""haitangwu@hotmail.com; 1067716566@qq.com"";zheng, zeyu/A-3867-2013;;;;;;69;;;;;;;;;;;;;SEP;2021;18;5;;;;;1209;1225;;10.1007/s11998-021-00480-2;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11998-021-00480-2;;JUN 2021;;;;;;;;;;;;View Full Record in Web of Science"

Graphene oxide (GO), due to its functional chemical groups, high mechanical properties, electrical conductivity, and excellent compatibility, has been widely applied in modification of polymer materials. In this work, two-dimensional graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets are introduced into PVDF NFMs through the use of the GO/PVDF blending-electrospinning and GO@PVDF surface coating methods to prepare a highly efficient air filter, respectively. Different GO loadings lead to NFMs with diverse surface properties, static electricity, nanofiber diameters, and air filtration performances. The basic properties, filtration performance and effects of the GO loading strategies of the optimized GO/PVDF and GO@PVDF NFMs are systematically compared and analyzed. In general, blending GO in a PVDF solution before electrospinning may significantly enhance the spinnability and static electricity. Meanwhile, GO with lamellar structure is of great benefit to provide the nucleation basis for beta-PVDF, which can significantly endow the membrane with good particle capture capacity. The obtained GO/PVDF NFMs show a higher PM2.5 removal efficiency of 99.31% and better reusability than the pristine PVDF NFMs (93.74%) and GO@PVDF NFMs (95.41%).

Among genes encoding the insulin signaling pathway, prolonged exposure to PM2.5 caused a decrease in the expression levels of daf-16 and daf-18 genes and an increase in the expression levels of daf-2, akt-1, and pdk-1 genes. Meanwhile, PM2.5 exposure increased the DAF-16::GFP nuclear localization. Mutations of the daf-2 gene encoding the insulin receptor restored deficits in both intestinal development and intestinal function in PM2.5 exposed nematodes. In contrast, mutations of the daf-16 gene encoding the FOXO transcription factor caused more severe damage on both intestinal development and intestinal function in PM2.5 exposed nematodes. Moreover, DAF-16 might regulate the toxicity of PM2.5 on the intestine through the functions of its downstream targets such as SOD-3, a manganese-superoxide dismutase.

The induction effect of GO prevents the melting and fusion of PAN nanofibers, as well as increases the heat resistant, flame retardancy, and PM filtration performance.

Additionally, we introduce lignin nanoparticles (LNP) as carriers for growing zinc oxide (ZnO), forming organic-inorganic hybrid particles (LNP@ZnO). This approach minimizes the negative impact of ZnO on the mechanical properties of the sponge while enhancing antibacterial performance.

The procedure was applied to extract endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) consisting of three phthalate esters (PEs) and bisphenol A (BPA) associated with PM2.5 (airborne particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m). Gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) was used for determination of the analytes. These analytes were first ultrasonically desorbed from PM2.5 in a 10% acetone aqueous solution. DLLME was used to first preconcentrate the analytes; the sample solution, still in the same vial, was then subjected to VA-mu-SPE. The synergistic effects provided by the combination of the microextraction techniques provided advantages such as high enrichment factors and good cleanup performance. Various extraction parameters such as type and volume of extractant solvent (for DLLME), and type of sorbent, extraction time, desorption solvent, volume of desorption solvent and desorption time (for mu-SPE) were evaluated. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes were found to be the most suitable sorbent. This procedure achieved good precision with intraand inter-day relative standard deviations of between 1.93 and 9.95%. Good linearity ranges (0.3-100 ng/mL and 0.5-100 ng/mL, depending on analytes), and limits of detection (LODs) of between 0.07 and 0.15 ng/mL were obtained. The method was used to determine the levels of PEs and BPA in ambient air, with concentrations ranging between below the limits of quantification and 0.48 ng/m(3). DLLME-VA-mu-SPE-GC-MS/MS was demonstrated to be suitable for the determination of these EDCs present in PM2.5. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

This paper discusses the regeneration performance of reduced graphite oxide filter materials, which were studied in depth using water cleaning and the relevant parameters, including the cleaning times. The results showed that water cleaning was most effective using a 20 L/(s.m(2)) water flow velocity with a 17 s cleaning time. The filtration efficiency decreased as the number of cleanings increased. Compared to the blank group, the filter material's PM10 filtration efficiency decreased by 0.8%, 19.4%, 26.5%, and 32.4% after the first to fourth cleanings, respectively. The filter material's PM2.5 filtration efficiency increased by 12.5% after the first cleaning, and decreased by 12.9%, 17.6%, and 30.2% after the second to fourth cleanings, respectively. The filter material's PM1.0 filtration efficiency increased by 22.7% after the first cleaning, and decreased by 8.1%, 13.8%, and 24.5% after the second to fourth cleanings, respectively. Water cleaning mainly affected the filtration efficiency of particulates sized 0.3-2.5 mu m. Reduced graphite oxide air filter materials could be water washed twice and maintain cleanliness equal to 90% of the original filter material.

The characteristics of EPFRs, that is., their concentration, type and lifetime, were obtained based on their electron paramagnetic resonance spectra. The results showed that the EPFRs in the PM2.5 samples were carbon-centered with a nearby heteroatom (g = 2.0031) and had a long half-life of more than 3 years. Nearly all of the extractable EPFRs were detected in the water-insoluble organic fraction and showed characteristics indicating that may contain oxygen-centered radical (g = 2.0038). Most of the total EPFRs in the PM2.5 were derived from solvent-resistant organic matter (88%), which likely consisted of graphene oxide analogues. The results suggest that previous studies may have missed the major proportion of EPFRs in atmospheric particulates if they only focused on solvent-extractable or metallic oxide-formed EPFRs.

But many challenges and knowledge gaps are still confronted nowadays. On one hand, long-term health impacts of fine air particles have to be closely probed through both epidemiological and laboratory studies, and the toxic effects owing to the interactions between particles and associated chemical pollutants should be differentially teased out. On the other hand, due to sole mass control, there are significant changes of overall pollutant fingerprint, such as the increase of ground-level ozone concentration, which should be taken into account for altered health effects relative to the past. Moreover, the interplays with air pollutants and air-borne pathogens should be scrutinized in more details. In other words, it is worth investigating likely spread of pathogens (even for SARS-CoV-2) with aid of aerosols.

Exposure to PM2.5 also increases the risk of respiratory diseases. Through sulfur-carbon bonds and the edge S effect, GOQDs were used to bind in single-layer molybdenum disulfide (SLMoS2) nanosheets to synthesize SLMoS2@GOQDs heterojunction structures. GOQDs doping greatly increased the water solubility and stabilized of SLMoS2. SLMoS2@GOQDs with catalase-like activity protected cells from ultrastructural and cytomembrane damage and apoptosis induced by LPS. Moreover, the doping of GOQDs enhanced the escape of SLMoS2@GOQDs from cellular uptake and suppressed the release of Mo ions. Nanosheet-cell interface interactions that were regulated by quantum dots supported these positive effects. Immunofluorescence analysis and cell imaging confirmed that the nanomaterial protected against cell injury by regulating the canonical Wnt/ beta-catenin pathway and the secretion of relevant cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Moreover, SLMoS2@GOQDs also mitigated pneumonia caused by PM2.5 in vivo.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms for this response are still largely unclear. Using in vivo assay system of Caenorhabditis elegans, we here found that antimicrobial proteins of LYS-1, LYS-8, SPP-1, DOD-6, and F55G11.4 were activated by graphene oxide (GO) exposure. These antimicrobial proteins functioned as molecular targets of transcriptional factor DAF-16 in insulin signaling pathway, and acted in intestine to regulate the response to GO. Among these antimicrobial proteins, DOD-6, F55G11.4, and SPP-1 participated in the formation of signaling cascade of DAF-16-DOD-6-SOD-3-F55G11.4/SPP-1 in response to GO exposure by activating the antioxidation system. Different from this, LYS-1 and LYS-8, two lysozymes, mediated TUB-2 signaling and DAF-8-DAF-5 signaling cascade, respectively, to regulate the response to GO exposure. During the regulation of response to GO exposure, LYS-1 and LYS-8 acted synergistically, which could be largely explained by the observed synergistic interaction between TUB-2 and DAF-8. Therefore, our results demonstrate the crucial protection role of antimicrobial proteins for animals in response to environmental ENMs' exposure.

On the GLDH/Fe3O4/GR/CS/GCE, GLDH catalyzed the reversible reaction, i.e., the reductive amination of alpha-ketoglutaric acid and the oxidative deamination of L-glutamate. The electrons produced in the enzymatic reactions were transferred to the surface of the electrode via the [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) couple, which helped for the amplification of the electrochemical signal. The electrochemical detection of NH4+ was based on the fact that the enhanced response current was proportional to the NH4+ concentration. Owing to the combination of the advantages of the synergistic effects of Fe3O4 nanospheres, GR and CS, a promising platform for NH4+ sensing was provided. Under optimum conditions, the introduced biosensor had a linear range of 0.4-2.0 mu M for NH4+ with the detection and quantification limits of 0.08 and 0.27 mu M, respectively.

However, the role of ERK signaling in the regulation of response to engineered nanomaterial exposure is still largely unclear. In this study, using in vivo assay system of Caenorhabditis elegans, we investigated the function of ERK signaling in response to graphene oxide (GO) exposure and the underlying molecular mechanism. GO exposure increased the expression of MEK-2/MEK and MPK-1/ERK in the ERK signaling pathway. Mutation of mek-2 or mpk-1 resulted in a susceptibility to GO toxicity. Both the MEK-2 and the MPK-1 acted in neurons to regulate the response to GO exposure, and the neuronal expression of MEK-2 or MPK-1 caused a resistance to GO toxicity. In the neurons, SKN-1b/Nrf acted downstream of the MPK-1, and AEX-3, a guanine exchange factor for GTPase, further acted downstream of the SKN-1b to regulate the response to GO exposure. Therefore, a signaling cascade of MEK-2-MPK-1-SKN-1b/-AEX-3 was identified in the neurons required for the regulation of response to GO exposure. Moreover, genetic interaction assay demonstrated that the neuronal ERK signaling-mediated signaling pathway and the intestinal p38 MAPK-mediated signaling pathway functioned synergistically in the regulation of response to GO exposure.

This study aimed to develop sustainable filtration materials from cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) modified with graphene oxide (GO) to capture fine particulates from air effectively. CNFs were extracted from alpha-cellulose via mechanical grinding and modified with 0.5-1.5 wt% GO solution by ultrasonication to produce CNF-GO nanocomposites. These were freeze-dried into highly porous, lightweight aerogels for air filtration applications. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) confirmed GO incorporation through hydroxyl group interactions. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) revealed a porous 3D network with reduced porosity after GO addition due to pore blocking. X-ray diffraction analysis showed the cellulose I crystal structure was retained after modification. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) measurements indicated increased density but decreased surface area and pore volume with GO loading. The thermogravimetric analysis demonstrated improved thermal stability with GO incorporation due to oxidative reactions and a barrier effect. The particulate absorption efficiency markedly increased from 86.37 % to 99.98 % for CNFs modified with 1.5 wt% GO due to the high surface area, surface oxygen functionalities, and nanoplatelet morphology of GO. The nanofiber filters with 1.5 wt% GO exhibited a maximum absorption efficiency of 99.98 % and a quality factor of 0.0912 Pa-1. Although GO reduced biodegradability, substantial degradation occurred under soil conditions.

Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism of mir-231 in the regulation of GO toxicity using in vivo assay system of Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that GO exposure inhibited the expression of mir-231::GFP in multiple tissues, in particular in the intestine. mir-231 acted in intestine to regulate the GO toxicity, and overexpression of mir-231 in intestine caused a susceptible property of nematodes to GO toxicity. smk-1 encoding a homologue to mammalian SMEK functioned as a targeted gene for mir-231, and was also involved in the intestinal regulation of GO toxicity. Mutation of smk-1 gene induced a susceptible property to GO toxicity, whereas the intestinal overexpression of smk-1 resulted in a resistant property to GO toxicity. Moreover, mutation of smk-1 gene suppressed the resistant property of mir-231 mutant to GO toxicity. In nematodes, SMK-1 further acted upstream of the transcriptional factor DAF-16/FOXO in insulin signaling pathway to regulate GO toxicity. Therefore, mir-231 may encode a GO-responsive protection mechanism against the GO toxicity by suppressing the function of the SMK-1 - DAF-16 signaling cascade in nematodes.;""[Yang, Ruilong; Rui, Qi] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Life Sci, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yang, Ruilong; Ren, Mingxia; Wang, Dayong] Southeast Univ, Sch Med, Minist Educ, Key Lab Environm Med Engn, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China"";""Nanjing Agricultural University; Southeast University - China"";""Rui, Q (corresponding author), Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Life Sci, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Wang, DY (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Med, Minist Educ, Key Lab Environm Med Engn, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China."";""ruiqi@njau.edu.cn; dayongw@seu.edu.cn"";""rui, qi/KIK-8865-2024; yang, ruilong/JBJ-6982-2023"";;;;;;41;;;;;;;;;;;;;AUG 25;2016;6;;;;;;;;32214;10.1038/srep32214;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep32214;;;;;;;;;;;;;;View Full Record in Web of Science"

Graphene oxide was obtained through an electrochemical exfoliation of graphite recovered from exhausted batteries.

The composites were compared to both pure polypropylene and polypropylene/carbon black composites. The samples were characterized based on their melt flow index, thermal stability, crystallinity, flammability, and mechanical and rheological properties. The formulations containing graphene oxide obtained from the recycling of exhausted batteries exhibited superior thermal properties and melt flow index compared to pure polypropylene. In addition, the composites containing 0.7% of graphene oxide showed an increase in flow index compared to the composite containing carbon black. The rheological properties of samples containing graphene oxide had values closer to pure polypropylene compared to those containing only hyperdispersant or carbon black. The increase in the flow index of a composite containing graphene oxide can result in energy cost savings during processing.

The use of this novel-synthesized substance for removing pollutants from an aqueous solution was studied. The composition and morphology of GO/Fe3O4 grafted with TSP and dendrimer (GO/Fe3O4/TSP/Den) were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, vibrating-sample magnetometer, and thermogravimetric analysis. Parameters such as solution pH, contact time, adsorption isotherm, and reusability were evaluated.

This study focuses on the heterogeneous formation of EPFRs on the graphene oxide (GO), the dominant component of carbonaceous PM. First-principles calculations have been performed to investigate the interaction between 2-chlorophenol (2-CP), an important precursor of EPFRs, and GO to find the stable adsorption configurations. The climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method and Dimer method were employed to explore the decomposition route of 2-CP to generate different types of EPFRs on the GO surface. The results indicate that aromatic precursors tend to undergo homolytic fission rather than heterolytic splitting to form EPFRs induced by surface oxygen-containing groups and carbon defects on the carbonaceous PM. Surface OH groups and water, both of which are related to ambient humidity, play essential roles in producing EPFRs. The formation mechanism of EPFRs over GO unveiled in this study, which represents dramatic differences from the conventional mechanism on the metal oxide surfaces, may account for a previously overlooked source of EPFRs encountered in atmospheric PM.;""[Wang, Wei; Liu, Zhenhua; Li, Yanxia; Wang, Wenxing; Zhang, Qingzhu; Wang, Qiao] Shandong Univ, Environm Res Inst, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China"";Shandong University;Zhang, QZ (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Environm Res Inst, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China.;zqz@sdu.edu.cn;Zhang, Qingzhu/S-7221-2019;;;;;;56;;;;;;;;;;;;;NOV 15;2022;602;;;;;;;;154316;10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.154316;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.154316;;JUL 2022;;;;;;;;;;;;View Full Record in Web of Science"

UPM can rapidly pass into and persist within systemic circulation. However, few studies exist on whether UPM may have any impact on blood components. In this study, UPM standards (SRM1648a) were used to assess the influence of UPM on erythrocyte quality in terms of oxidative and metabolic damage as well as phagocytosis by macrophages in vitro and clearance in vivo. Our results showed that UPM had weak haemolytic properties. It can oxidise hae-moglobin and influence the oxygen-carrying function, redox balance, and metabolism of erythrocytes. UPM increases the content of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreases antioxidant function according to the data of malonaldehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH). UPM can adhere to or be internalised by erythrocytes at higher concentrations, which can alter their morphology. Su-peroxide radicals produced in the co-incubation system further disrupted the structure of red blood cell membranes, thereby lowering the resistance to the hypotonic solution, as reflected by the osmotic fragility test. Moreover, UPM leads to an increase in phosphatidylserine exposure in erythrocytes and subsequent clearance by the mononuclear phagocytic system in vivo. Altogether, this study suggests that the primary function of eryth-rocytes may be affected by UPM, providing a warning for erythrocyte quality in severely polluted areas. For critically ill patients, transfusion of erythrocytes with lesions in morphology and function will have serious clinical consequences, suggesting that potential risks should be considered during blood donation screening.

In this work, a novel kind of graphene-based multifunctional nanofiller (La@PN-RGO) was fabricated via the nitrogen doping and the decoration with organophosphorus and lanthanum based on graphene oxide, which is then incorporated into acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) resin via melt blending to obtain resultant ABS nanocomposites. As expected, the La@PN-RGO nanosheets were well dispersed in ABS composites. Attractively, with only 1.0 wt % of La@PN-RGO incorporated into ABS matrix, the peak heat release rate (PHRR) and total smoke production (TSP) were significantly reduced by 38% and 36%, which is much superior to its counterparts at the same nanofillers loading level. The notably enhanced fire safety was primarily attributed to the rare earth catalysis accompanied by the lamellae blocking effect and intumescent flame retardancy of La@PN-RGO.

Chrysene (CHR), a priority pollutant known for its toxicity and persistence, necessitates the development of sensitive and cost-effective detection methods. In this study, we report, for the first time, a highly sensitive voltammetric sensor for CHR detection using a composite of NH2-MIL-101(Fe) and thermally reduced graphene oxide (TRGO) modified glassy carbon electrode (NH2-MIL-101(Fe)/TRGO/GCE). The composite was prepared via ultrasonication of TRGO with NH2-MIL-101(Fe) and synthesized using a microwave-assisted method. Comprehensive physicochemical characterization, including various spectroscopic and electrochemical measurements alongside thermogravimetry and N-2 adsorption isotherms, confirmed the composite's crystallinity, high porosity, and conductivity. Under optimal conditions, the NH2-MIL-101(Fe)/TRGO/GCE sensor achieved a low limit of detection (0.037 mu M), high sensitivity (0.345 mu A mu M-1), and a wide linear detection range (0.1-240 mu M). The sensor demonstrated superior selectivity for CHR, even in the presence of other carcinogenic PAHs, including naphthalene, phenanthrene, fluorene, pyrene, and benzo[a]pyrene. These impressive attributes were primarily due to the synergistic effects of the composite, including strong pi-pi interaction and rapid electron transfer. Furthermore, the sensor showed excellent selectivity, reproducibility, and high recovery rates when applied to CHR detection in complex PM samples and other contaminant sources such as soil and river water. These results demonstrate the NH2-MIL-101(Fe)/TRGO/GCE sensor as a promising technology for pollutant analysis and environmental monitoring in practical applications.;""[Karuppiah, Chelladurai; Kim, Seongyeop; Lee, So Yeon; Lee, Gyudong; Ahmed, Imteaz; Jhung, Sung Hwa; Lee, Hye Jin] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Dept Chem & Green Nano Mat, Res Ctr, 80 Daehakro, Daegu City 41566, South Korea; [Baek, Song-Yee; Yim, Yong-Hyeon] Korea Res Inst Stand & Sci KRISS, Div Chem & Mat Metrol, Daejeon 34113, South Korea; [Alam, Rafiqul; Kim, Min-Sik] Daegu Gyeongbuk Inst Sci & Technol DGIST, Dept New Biol, Daegu, South Korea"";""Kyungpook National University (KNU); Korea Research Institute of Standards & Science (KRISS); Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science & Technology (DGIST)"";Lee, HJ (corresponding author), Kyungpook Natl Univ, Dept Chem & Green Nano Mat, Res Ctr, 80 Daehakro, Daegu City 41566, South Korea.;;""Karuppiah, Chelladurai/H-7068-2019; Jhung, Sung/AAO-6683-2021; Kim, Min-Sik/KFS-9148-2024; Kim, Min-Sik/M-3488-2016"";Kim, Min-Sik/0000-0001-7317-5360;;;;;75;;;;;;;;;;;;;DEC 15;2025;445;;;;;;;;138539;10.1016/j.snb.2025.138539;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2025.138539;;;;;;;;;;;;;;View Full Record in Web of Science"

We employed the in vivo assay system of Caenorhabditis elegans to investigate the possible transgenerational toxicity of nanopolystyrene particles and the underlying cellular mechanisms. After prolonged exposure, we observed the toxicity of nanopolystyrene particles at concentrations higher than 10 mu g L-1. The transgenerational toxicity was further detected in nematodes exposed to nanopolystyrene particles at concentrations higher than 100 mu g L-1. This observed transgenerational toxicity of nanopolystyrene particles might be mainly due to the translocation of nanopolystyrene particles into reproductive organs such as the gonad, which potentially in turn led to the transfer of nanopolystyrene particles to the next generation. Leachates from nanopolystyrene particles at concentrations in the range of mu g L-1 did not contribute to the development of this transgenerational toxicity. Enhancement of intestinal permeability and extension of defecation cycle length provide the explanation for the observed accumulation and translocation of nanopolystyrene particles in reproductive organs. Therefore, our results demonstrate the potential transgenerational toxicity of nanopolystyrene particles in the range of mu g L-1 in environmental organisms.;""[Zhao, Li; Qu, Man; Wang, Dayong] Southeast Univ, Med Sch, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wong, Garry] Univ Macau, Fac Hlth Sci, Macau, Peoples R China"";""Southeast University - China; University of Macau"";Wang, DY (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Med Sch, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;dayongw@seu.edu.cn;""; Qu, Man/X-4551-2019"";""Man, Qu/0000-0003-0144-6971;"";;;;;60;;;;;;;;;;;;;DEC;2017;4;12;;;;;2356;2366;;10.1039/c7en00707h;http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7en00707h;;;;;;;;;;;;;;View Full Record in Web of Science"

The results indicate that EC particles and wax can form C-H center dot center dot center dot pi type hydrogen bonding with charge transfer from carbon to wax; therefore, strong attraction is expected between them due to the cooperativity of hydrogen bonding and London dispersion from instantaneous dipoles. In reality, once settled on the leaf surface, especially without wax ultrastructures, BC with extremely large surface-to-volume ratio will likely stick and stay. On the other hand, BC particles can lead to phase transition of epicuticular wax from crystalline to amorphous structures by creating packing disorder and end-gauche defects of wax molecular chain, potentially causing water loss and thereby damage of plants."";""[Wang, Lei; Gong, Huili; Peng, Nian] Capital Normal Univ, Coll Resource Environm & Tourism, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jin Z.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Chem & Biochem, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA"";""Capital Normal University; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz"";""Gong, HL (corresponding author), Capital Normal Univ, Coll Resource Environm & Tourism, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China.;Zhang, JZ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Chem & Biochem, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA."";""gonghl@cnu.edu.cn; zhang@ucsc.edu"";;""Zhang, Jin/0000-0003-3437-912X; Wang, Lei/0000-0003-3276-8973"";;;;;60;;;;;;;;;;;;;MAY 1;2018;52;9;;;;;5182;5190;;10.1021/acs.est.7b06088;http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.7b06088;;;;;;;;;;;;;;View Full Record in Web of Science"

Among the air pollutants, PM2.5 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m) is the most dangerous because of its toxicity and impact on human health and ecosystems. However, there has been limited research on PM2.5 particle toxicity. In the present study, we collected daily PM2.5 samples from January 1 to March 31, 2018 and selected samples to extract water-soluble species, including SO42-, NO3-, WSOC, and NH4+. These samples represented clean, good, slight, moderate, and heavy pollution days. After extraction using an ultrasonic method, PM2.5 solutions were obtained. We used Chlorella as the test algae and studied the content of chlorophyll a, as well as the variation in fluorescence when they were placed into the PM2.5 extraction solution, and their submicroscopic structure was analyzed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed that when the air quality was relatively clean and good (PM2.5 concentration <= 75 mu g m(-3)), the PM2.5 extraction solutions had no inhibiting effects on Chlorella, whereas when the air quality was polluted (PM2.5 concentration > 75 mu g m(-3)) and heavily polluted (PM(2. )concentration > 150 mu gm(-3)), with increasing PM2.5 concentrations and exposure time, the chlorophyll a content in Chlorella decreased. Moreover, the maximum photochemical quantum yield (F-v/F-m) of Chlorella obviously decreased, indicating chlorophyll inhibition during polluted days with increasing PM2.5 concentrations. The effects on the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were also obvious, leading to an increase of energy dissipated per unit reaction center (DIo/RC), suggesting that Chlorella could survive when exposed to PM2.5 solutions, whereas the physiological activities were significantly inhibited. The TEM analysis showed that there were few effects on Chlorella cell microstructure during clean days, whereas plasmolysis occurred during light- and medium-polluted days. With increasing pollution levels, plasmolysis became more and more apparent, until the organelles inside the cells were thoroughly destroyed and most of the parts could not be recognized.

Subacute exposure to 1-100 mu g/L of PS-MPs resulted in adverse physiological effects in C. elegans, and PS-MPs were ingested and accumulated in the intestine of C. elegans. Exposure to 100 mu g/L of PS-MPs significantly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, lipofuscin accumulation, and the expression oxidative stress-related genes, which suggests that PS-MPs exposure induced oxidative stress by ROS. In addition, exposure to 100 mu g/L of PS-MPs caused a hyperpermeable state of the intestinal barrier and altered the expression of genes related to intestinal development, which indicates intestinal damage in C. elegans. According to Pearson correlation analyses, oxidative stress and intestinal damagewere significantly correlated with adverse effects of PS-MPs in C. elegans. Therefore, it was speculated that the toxicity induced by PS-MPs resulted from the combination of oxidative stress and intestinal injury. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The MoS2/reduced graphene oxide/glassy carbon electrode (MoS2/rGO/GCE) was prepared using a simple and efficient electrochemical deposition method. The rationale behind selecting MoS2/rGO stems from their individual properties that, when combined, can enhance the electrode's performance. MoS2 offers excellent electro-catalytic activity and selectivity for nitrate ion detection, while rGO provides high conductivity and a large surface area for enhanced sensitivity. The electrochemical performance of MoS2/rGO/GCE was investigated and compared with MoS2/GCE and bare GCE using cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results demonstrated that MoS2/rGO/GCE exhibited enhanced electro-catalytic activity, high conductivity, and improved selectivity for nitrate ion detection. The optimal pH value for detecting nitrate ions was determined to be 8.0. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was employed to investigate the linear range and detection limit of nitrate ions on MoS2/rGO/GCE, resulting in a linear range from 1 to 300 & mu;M and a detection limit of 0.35 & mu;M.

Moreover, the functionalized nanofiber membranes exhibited a high removal efficiency (PM0.3-99.37%), a low air resistance (56 Pa), and keep 98.52% interception for PM0.3 after de-static treatment. Notably, it retained more than 92.00% (PM0.3) of its filtration performance after 72 h of wear. Thus, this work reveals that growing PDA flakes on nanofibers is a practical functionalization technique for high-efficiency mask filters.;""[Liu, Simeng; Shao, Weili; Niu, Jingyi; Wang, Kai; Han, Ruikai; Cao, Ying; Zhao, Xinxin; He, Jianxin] Zhongyuan Univ Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Text & Garment Ind, Zhengzhou 450007, Henan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xu; Zhang, Qiaoling] Henan Univ Engn, Sch Fash, Zhengzhou 451191, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Hui] Pingyuan Filter Co Ltd, 1 Dongyang Village, Xinxiang 453000, Peoples R China; [Hu, Jielun; Liu, Huan] Nanchang Univ, State Key Lab Food Sci & Resources, Nanchang 330031, Jiangxi, Peoples R China"";""Zhongyuan University of Technology; Henan University of Engineering; Nanchang University"";""Shao, WL; Cao, Y; He, JX (corresponding author), Zhongyuan Univ Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Text & Garment Ind, Zhengzhou 450007, Henan, Peoples R China."";""weilishao@163.com; 13203839989@163.com; hejianxin771117@163.com"";""Jianxin, He/JEZ-6795-2023; zhao, xinxin/AAD-4053-2019; Liu, Huan/IQU-2248-2023"";;;;;;48;;;;;;;;;;;;;JUN;2023;40;;;;;;;;101627;10.1016/j.coco.2023.101627;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coco.2023.101627;;JUN 2023;;;;;;;;;;;;View Full Record in Web of Science"

They demonstrate that Fe2O3 in the composite is populated in an amorphous state with ultrafine particle sizes, being distributed stably, uniformly, and widely on/in the RGO. Thus produced Am-Fe2O3 did not show any coagulation in acidic media at pH 2 and in the solid state at 80 degrees C for more than two months, although they converted to crystalline Fe3O4 nanoparticles under electron beam irradiation. They also showed conversion to crystalline Fe under visible light irradiation with the presence of reducing agents. The Am-Fe2O3/RGO composite was applied to photochemical reduction of H+ to form H-2 as a heterogeneous catalyst together with fluorescein as the photosensitizer and triethylamine as the electron donor.

In the present study, Caenorhabditis elegans as an in vivo model organism was employed to explore the multi-generational toxicity effects of graphene oxide and the underlying mechanisms. Endpoints including development and lifespan, locomotion behaviors, defecation cycle, brood sizes, and oxidative response were evaluated in the parental generation and subsequent five filial generations. After continuous exposure for several generations, worms grew smaller and lived shorter. The locomotion behaviors were reduced across the filial generations and these reduced trends were following the impairments of locomotion-related neurons. In addition, the extended defecation cycles from the third filial generation were in consistency with the relative size reduction of the defecation related neuron. Simultaneously, the fertility function of the nematode was impaired under consecutive exposure as reduced brood sizes and oocytes numbers, increased apoptosis of germline, and aberrant expression of reproductive related genes ced-3, ced-4, ced-9, egl-1 and ced-13 were detected in exposed worms. Furthermore, the antioxidant enzyme, SOD-3 was significantly increased in the parent and filial generations.

It is highly desirable for these particles to remain well dispersed in oil without relying on molecular ligands. Borrowing from the analogy that pieces of paper that are crumpled do not readily stick to each other (unlike flat sheets), we expect that ultrafine particles resembling miniaturized crumpled paper balls should self-disperse in oil and could act like nanoscale ball bearings to reduce friction and wear. Here we report the use of crumpled graphene balls as a high-performance additive that can significantly improve the lubrication properties of polyalphaolefin base oil. The tribological performance of crumpled graphene balls is only weakly dependent on their concentration in oil and readily exceeds that of other carbon additives such as graphite, reduced graphene oxide, and carbon black.

In this accident mitigation strategy, the decay heat removal capability depends on whether the imposed heat flux exceeds critical heat flux (CHF). To provide sufficient cooling for high-power reactors such as APR1400, there have been some R&D efforts to use the reactor vessel with micro-porous coating and nanofluids boiling-induced coating. In present study, an experimental study has been conducted to investigate the viability of using graphene-oxide nanofluid under various coolant chemical environments to enhance CHF during ERVC. Pool boiling CHF experiments were carried out for the thin-wire heater with controlling the heater orientation from horizontal to vertical, or at 0 < theta < 90 degrees. The dispersion stability of graphene-oxide nanofluid in the chemical conditions of flooding water that includes boric acid, lithium hydroxide (DOH), and tri-sodium phosphate (TSP) was checked in terms of surface charge or zeta potential before the CHF experiments. Finally integral effects of graphene-oxide nanosheets and chemicals on CHF limits were investigated.

The structural and vibrational characterizations confirmed the formation of a pure cubic spinel phase in as-synthesized MnCo2O4 particles. The surface morphology analyses revealed the porous structure with an average particle size of 5 nm and uniform distribution of manganese (Mn), cobalt (Co), and oxygen (O) in the particles. We observed the presence of multiple valence states of Mn and Co, occupying both tetrahedral and octahedral sites, enhancing our insight into the material's electronic properties and structural configuration. Our magnetization studies unveiled a Curie Temperature (TC) of 185 K with ferrimagnetic ordering below TC, resulting in substantial magnetization (9.8 emu/g) and coercivity (3.46 kOe) at 2 K and weak magnetic behavior above TC. This is attributed to the finite size and surface effects. Furthermore, the incorporation of MnCo2O4 nanoparticles and graphene oxide into a polyurethane foam matrix resulted in an excellent sound absorption coefficient of 90 % at 2000 Hz.

However, the unavoidably combined effects of nanoplastics and microplastics on organisms, particularly intestinal toxicity, are rarely clear. Here, we employed Caenorhabditis elegans to investigate the combined effects of PS-50 (50 nm nanopolystyrene) and PS-500 (500 nm micropolystyrene) at environmentally relevant concentrations on the functional state of the intestinal barrier. Environmentally, after long-term treatment (4.5 days), coexposure to PS-50 (10 and 15 mu g/L) and PS-500 (1 mu g/L) resulted in more severe formation of toxicity in decreasing locomotion behavior, in inhibiting brood size, in inducing intestinal ROS production, and in inducting intestinal autofluorescence production, compared with single-exposure to PS-50 (10 and 15 mu g/L) or PS-500 (1 mu g/L). Additionally, coexposure to PS-50 (15 mu g/L) and PS-500 (1 mu g/L) remarkably caused an enhancement in intestinal permeability, but no detectable abnormality of intestinal morphology was observed in wild-type nematodes. Lastly, the downregulation of acs-22 or erm-1 expression and the upregulation expressions of genes required for controlling oxidative stress (sod-2, sod-3, isp-1, clk-1, gas-1, and ctl-3) served as a molecular basis to strongly explain the formation of intestinal toxicity caused by coexposure to PS-50 (15 mu g/L) and PS-500 (1 mu g/L).

This study focused on preparing reduced graphene oxide (r- GO) to modify filters used in air particle monitoring devices. The goal was to investigate how r-GO affects PM adsorption efficiency. Various spectroscopic techniques, including energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), inductively coupled plasma (ICP), and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), were used to assess the modified filters' adsorption efficiency quantitatively and qualitatively towards PMs. The results showed that r-GO-modified filters revealed higher PM adsorption efficiency than control filters.

In this work, a new type of high-efficiency polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) air filter was successfully prepared by employing silver nanoparticles decorated with graphene oxide (Ag NPs/GO) functional materials that deposited in PTFE substrate membranes hydrophilic modified with TiO2 for the improvement of the enclosed space air quality. The results revealed that the introduction of TiO2 can improve the interfacial adhesion between PTFE membrane and functional materials, improving the feasibility of long-term application of composite membrane. The composite membrane possessed the crisscross network structure interconnected by fibrils, which gives the membrane high efficiency particulate matters (PMs) removal rate (99.25% for PM2.5) without sacrificing the pressure drop (90.52 Pa). Moreover, the prepared composite membrane also has more excellent antibacterial performance (98.7% for Escherichia coli (E. coli)), which can reduce the secondary pollution caused by improper posttreatment of the polluted filter in practical applications. After simple cleaning and regeneration, the composite membrane can still maintain an ultra-high particle removal rate (over 95%) after 5 cycles.

They play an important role in the formation and growth of atmospheric particles. As such, there is a pressing need to monitor these particle-bound compounds present at trace quantities. The present work describes an efficient, one-step microextraction technique for the preconcentration and detection of trace levels of 10 aliphatic amines on fine particles (particulate matter of 2.5 mu,m or less (PM2,5,)) in the atmosphere. After extraction of amines from particles in acidified water samples, carbon-based sorbents (in dispersive solid-phase extraction mode), and vortex agitation were utilized for simultaneous derivatization-extraction and dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction. The approach significantly increased the recoveries and enrichment of the amine derivatives. This one-step, combined technique is proposed for the first time. Several influential factors including type and concentration of derivatization reagent (for gas chromatographic separation), type of buffer, sample pH, types and volumes of extraction and disperser solvents, type and amount of sorbent, vortex time and temperature, desorption solvent type and volume, and salt content were investigated and optimized. Under the optimum conditions, high enrichment factors (in the range of between 307 and 382) and good reproducibility (relative standard deviations, below 7.0%, n=5) were achieved. The linearity ranged from 0.1 mu g/L-100 mu g/L, and from 0.5 mu g/L-100 a, depending on the analytes. The limits of detection were between 0.02 mu g/L., (corresponding to 0.01 similar to ng/m(3) in air) and 0.09 mu g/L. (corresponding to similar to 0.04 ng/m(3) in air). The developed method was successfully applied to the analysis of PM2.5 samples collected by air sampling through polytetrafluoroethylene filters. The concentration levels of amines ranged from 1.04 to 4.16 ng/m(3) in the air sampled. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The designed rGL-Z67/Z8 CS structures were loaded with Trisodium phosphate (TSP) inhibitor and its multi-functional action for providing a smart anti-corrosion epoxy system was studied in detail. In the solution containing nano-hybrids extract the significantly retarded steel corrosion in the presence of the TSP-loaded rGL-Z67/Z8 structure was proved. Mixed inhibition of the reduction of oxygen/water and Fe dissolution together with a significant degree of inhibition > 90 % were recorded for about 48 h, declaring a strong inhibition index of the designed nano-hybrids. The controlled/pH-triggered inhibitor release activity of the rGL-Z67/Z8 structure was proved by ICP/UV-vis analyses. The scratched TSP-loaded rGL-Z67/Z8 nano-hybrids-filled epoxy systems showed long-lasting self-repairing properties, proving the controlled inhibitor release from LDH and Z67/Z8 structures and the formation of a protective layer over the scratch site.

In the current study, the oxidation potential measured by dithiothreitol (DTT) decay rate and the cytotoxicity to murine macrophage cells of different functionalized carbon nanomaterials were investigated to understand the role of functionalization in their toxicities. The DTT decay rates of special black 4A (SB4A), graphene, graphene oxide, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), SWCNT-OH and SWCNT-COOH were 45.9 +/- 3.0, 58.5 +/- 6.6, 160.7 +/- 21.7, 38.9 +/- 8.9, 57.0 +/- 7.2 and 36.7 +/- 0.2 pmol min(-1) mu g(-1), respectively. Epoxide was found to be mainly responsible for the highest DTT decay rate of graphene oxide compared to other carbon nanomaterials based on comprehensive characterizations. Both carboxylation and hydroxylation showed little influence on the oxidation potential of carbon nanomaterials, while epoxidation contributes to the enhancement of oxidation potential. All these carbon nanomaterials were toxic to the murine J774 cell line. However, oxidized carbon nanomaterials (graphene oxide, SWCNT-OH and SWCNT-COOH) showed weaker cytotoxicity to the J774 cell line compared to the corresponding control sample as far as the metabolic activity was considered and stronger cytotoxicity to the J774 cell line regarding the membrane integrity and DNA incorporation.

With an achievement by converting toxic contaminants into valuable products, this research explores the waste-turned treasures of exhaust PM pollution. Here, we rationally design a PM filter composed of homogeneously decorated zeolite imidazole framework-67 (ZIF-67) on a porous network of reduced graphene oxide aerogel (named as ZIF-67/rGA). The ZIF-67/rGA captures PM with excellent removal efficiency both in dynamic and static systems as a result of impressive specific surface area, continuous 3D networks, and numerous active sites. Highly porous Co3O4/N-rGA derived from PM@ZIF-67/rGA is achieved via an in situ thermal carbonization and activation process. The synergistic effect of porous Co3O4 nanoparticles and rich N-doped graphene aerogel contributes to the unprecedented electrochemical performance. Co3O4/N-rGA demonstrated a superior capacitance of 1485 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1), which is superior to that of Co3O4/r-GA (249 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)) obtained by direct pyrolysis of ZIF-67/r-GA.

The unique structure and composition of ZB/RGO were efficaciously confirmed by XRD, FTIR, SEM, TEM, and TG. The incorporation of 7.71 wt% ZB/RGO could significantly enhance the synergistic effect with Mg(OH)(2) (MH) when mixed with poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) as a flame retardant and smoke suppressant, as evaluated by limited oxygen index (LOI), microscale combustion calorimetry (MCC), and a cone calorimetry test (CCT) and compared with PVC, PVC/ZB, PVC/MH, and PVC/ZB/MH blends. The PVC/ZB/RGO/MH formulation could achieve an LOI value of 29.5% (24% higher than neat PVC). More importantly, the heat release rate (HRR), peak heat release rate (PHRR), smoke production rate (SPR), perk smoke production rate (PSPR), total smoke production (TSP), and mass amount loss (MAL) were considerably reduced in CCT, especially the PHRR, TSP, and MAL values for PVC/ZB/RGO/MH blends were reduced to 35%, 34%, and 15%, respectively.

In the fabricated Fe3O4 NPs@p-rGO/Ni electrode, the porous rGO sheets served as a conductive network to facilitate the collection and transportation of electrons during the charge/discharge cycles, improving the conductivity of magnetite NPs and providing a larger specific surface area. As a result, the Fe3O4 NPs@p-rGO/Ni exhibited a specific capacitance of 1323 F g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) and 79% capacitance retention when the current density is increased 20 times, where the Fe3O4 NPs/Ni electrode showed low specific capacitance of 357 F g(-1) and 43% capacity retention.

However, existing portable approaches are either not capable of performing integrated on-site analysis or not yet practically applicable. Exploiting graphene oxide (GO) in enhancing the analytical performance of paper-based colorimetric detection, for the first time, this paper reports the development of a practically useful portable system for accurate, sensitive on-site characterization of trace metals in ambient particulate matter (PM). The system consists of GO-nanosheet-coated paper devices, unmanned aerial vehicle multiaxial sampling, and cellphone-based colorimetric detection. The increased specific surface area and the homogeneity of color distribution from the coating of GO improves the accuracy and sensitivity of the assays. Additionally, by leveraging a Wi-Fi camera, a self-developed app and a sample pretreatment cartridge, metal in PM samples can be readily processed and characterized on-site within 30 min. The effects of chip geometric design, pH, reaction volume, and metal interference on detection results have been studied. The detection limits of the system were calibrated to be 16.6, 5.1, and 9.9 ng for metals Fe, Cu, and Ni, respectively, which are comparable to the detection limits of commercial inductively coupled plasma (ICP) instruments, thus making our portable system practically useful.

By utilizing particles with unaltered chemical and physical properties, the method enables simple and fast screening of biological effects on specific cell types, making it a promising tool for assessing the cytotoxicity of particulate matter in ambient and occupational air. Platforms fabricated from cellulose acetate (CA) and poly[epsilon]caprolactone (PCL) were proven to be biocompatible and promoted the attachment and growth of the human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B. The PCL platforms were exposed to simulated occupational aerosols of silver, copper, and graphene oxide nanoparticles. Each nanoparticle type exhibited different and dose-dependent cytotoxic effects on cells, evidenced by reduced cell viability and distinct, particle type-dependent gene expression patterns. Notably, copper nanoparticles were identified as the most cytotoxic, and graphene oxide the least. Comparing the Cells-on-Particles and submerged exposure (Particles-on-Cells) testing strategies, BEAS-2B cells responded to selected nanoparticles in a comparable manner, suggesting the developed testing system could be proposed for further evaluation with more complex environmental aerosols. Despite limitations, including particle agglomeration and the need for more replicates to address variability, the Cells-on-Particles platform enables effective detection of toxicity induced by relatively low levels of nanoparticles, demonstrating good sensitivity and a relatively simpler procedure compared to standard 2D cell exposure methods.;""[Krugly, Edvinas; Ravikumar, Preethi; Bagdoniene, Lauryna; Ciuzas, Darius; Prasauskas, Tadas; Martuzevicius, Dainius] Kaunas Univ Technol, Dept Environm Technol, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Bagdonas, Edvardas; Raudoniute, Jovile; Aldonyte, Ruta] Ctr Innovat Med, Dept Regenerat Med, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Gutleb, Arno C.] Luxembourg Inst Sci & Technol LIST, Environm Res & Innovat ERIN Dept, Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg"";""Kaunas University of Technology; State Research Institute Centre for Innovative Medicine; Luxembourg Institute of Science & Technology"";Krugly, E (corresponding author), Radvilenu Pl 19-504, LT-50254 Kaunas, Lithuania.;edvinas.krugly@ktu.lt;""Krugly, Edvinas/P-2639-2018; Prasauskas, Tadas/I-9849-2018; Bagdonas, Edvardas/JNS-9787-2023; Gutleb, Arno/AAK-9182-2021; Martuzevicius, Dainius/A-7673-2010; Ciuzas, Darius/HGC-3980-2022; Aldonyte, Ruta/JXY-6070-2024"";""Bagdonas, Edvardas/0000-0002-4423-3063;"";;;;;37;;;;;;;;;;;;;NOV;2024;508;;;;;;;;153936;10.1016/j.tox.2024.153936;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2024.153936;;AUG 2024;;;;;;;;;;;;View Full Record in Web of Science"

AS mixed with glutaraldehyde and bovine serum albumin was immobilized on glassy carbon electrode (GCE), which was first modified with poly-L-lysine (PLL)/graphene (GR) hybrid and electrodeposited gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The characterizations were performed by TEM, SEM, FTIR, Raman spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. AS can catalyze 4-nitrocatechol sulfate (NCS) to hydrolyze to sulfate and 4-nitrocatcchol (NC), which is electroactive and an anodic current occurs at similar to 0.42 V vs. SCE. However, the production of NC would decrease in the presence of sulfate due to its inhibition effect on the enzymatic hydrolysis reaction, thus leading to a decrease in the oxidation current. The inhibition measurements were carried out by detecting this current decrease after adding sulfate. At optimal conditions, the inhibition rate was linear to -log [sulfate] in the concentration range from 1.0 x 10(-7) to 1.0 x 10(-5)M with the detection limit of 4.0 x 10(-8) M. The introduced biosensor was further applied to assay the sulfate constituent in PM2.5, and the results were verified by employing ion chromatography as a reference. It showed that the new biosensor has a promising application for sulfate detection in real samples. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms for GO-induced shortened longevity are still unclear. We employed Caenorhabditis elegans to investigate the possible involvement of insulin signaling pathway in the control of GO toxicity and its underlying molecular mechanisms. Mutation of daf-2, age-1, akt-1, or akt-2 gene induced a resistant property of nematodes to GO toxicity, while mutation of daf-16 gene led to a susceptible property of nematodes to GO toxicity, suggesting that GO may dysregulate the functions of DAF-2/IGF-1 receptor, AGE-1, AKT-1 and AKT-2-mediated kinase cascade, and DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor. Genetic interaction analysis suggested the involvement of signaling cascade of DAF-2-AGE-1-AKT-1/2-DAF-16 in the control of GO toxicity on longevity. Moreover, intestinal RNA interference (RNAi) analysis demonstrated that GO reduced longevity by affecting the functions of signaling cascade of DAF-2-AGE-1-AKT-1/2-DAF-16 in the intestine. DAF-16 could also regulate GO toxicity on longevity by functioning upstream of SOD-3, which encodes an antioxidation system that prevents the accumulation of oxidative stress. Therefore, intestinal insulin signaling may encode two different molecular mechanisms responsible for the GO toxicity in inducing the shortened longevity. Our results highlight the key role of insulin signaling pathway in the control of GO toxicity in organisms.;""[Zhao, Yunli; Yang, Ruilong; Wang, Dayong] Southeast Univ, Sch Med, Key Lab Environm Med Engn, Minist Educ, Nanjing 210009, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yunli] Bengbu Med Coll, Dept Prevent Med, Bengbu 233020, Peoples R China; [Yang, Ruilong; Rui, Qi] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Life Sci, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China"";""Southeast University - China; Bengbu Medical University; Nanjing Agricultural University"";Wang, DY (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Med, Key Lab Environm Med Engn, Minist Educ, Nanjing 210009, Peoples R China.;dayongw@seu.edu.cn;""Zhao, Ying/HTO-4462-2023; rui, qi/KIK-8865-2024; yang, ruilong/JBJ-6982-2023"";;;;;;43;;;;;;;;;;;;;APR 4;2016;6;;;;;;;;24024;10.1038/srep24024;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep24024;;;;;;;;;;;;;;View Full Record in Web of Science"

Herein, the in situ heterogeneous nucleation and growth of a three-dimensional (3D) Metal-organic framework (MOF, namely University of Oslo-66 (UiO-66)), complexing with carboxyl-functionalized two-dimensional (2D) graphene oxide (GO-COOH) or one-dimensional (1D) carbon nanotube (CNT-COOH), and synchronous attachment onto the surface of carboxyl-modified PBO fiber/fabric (PBO-COOH) with desirable surface modification effects were successfully materialized for the first time, based on a well-designed combination strategy that integrated the ingenious pre-assembly of reaction components on the surface of PBO-COOH fiber/fabric (mediated by multiple interactions among them) with a one-pot solvothermal reaction procedure. The as-fabricated PBOCOOH@UiO-66@GO-COOH (PUG) and PBO-COOH@UiO-66@CNT-COOH (PUT) fibers exhibited substantially elevated surface energies, surface roughness, interfacial shear strength (IFSS), and anti-UV aging properties (70.96 % and 85.93 %) compared to those of the desized PBO (PBO-Desized) fiber, primarily profiting from the excellent synergistic nano-enhancement and UV-protective effects of UiO-66 and GO-COOH or CNT-COOH. More encouragingly, the UV-resistant capabilities of PUG and PUT fibers after 96 and 144 h of UV irradiation were all within the range of state-of-the-art level among previously reported literature. Furthermore, the particulate matter removal, sound absorption, and noise reduction properties of PUG and PUT fabrics were expectedly strengthened in contrast with those of the PBO-Desized fabric, reaching the high and state-of-the-art levels among previously reported literature, respectively.

However, NH3 is a precursor of NOx and PM2.5 within the biogas, threatening ecological and human health. Therein, recycling waste NH3 from the biogas as a raw material of nitrogen fertilizer was tested by optimizing polyester as a sorbent material. After homogeneous catalysis, the converted polyester significantly increased the NH3 adsorption sites within polyester nanopores; correspondingly, the NH3 adsorption capacity increased from 0.56 mg center dot g(-1) to 84.07 mg center dot g(-1).

We explore antibacterial mechanisms using S. aureus and E. coli treated with QA NPs.

Moreover, we note that gene expression profiling methods, such as RNA sequencing, can be used to predict discover mechanisms of toxicity of QA NPs.

The two bio-based RPUFs contain modified polyols from castor oil, one of which was transamidated castor oil with diethanolamine (BIO1) and another was further modified epoxidized polyols in BIO1 with phenylphosphonic acid. The cellular structure, thermal, flame retardant and mechanical properties of RPUF via incorporation of expandable graphite (EG) and graphene oxide (GO) on a total fixed amount of 6 wt% were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermal conductivity, limiting oxygen index (LOI), vertical burning test (UL94) and cone calorimeter test (CCT), etc. The cellular structure indicated that GO facilitates the dispersion of EG and decreases the cell size of the foam. The thermal and fire behaviors indicated that GO increased the insulation capacity and the flame-retardant performance of RPUFs. The optimal sample BIO2/EG/GO obtained V-0 rating, whereas BIO2/EG obtained only V-2 rating on the UL94 test. Moreover, results from CCT showed that the BIO2/EG/GO effectively reduced heat release rate (HRR), total heat release (THR) and total smoke production (TSP) by 54%, 24% and 15%, respectively, in comparison with BIO1 and decreased the HRR and THR 46% and 6%, respectively, compared to BIO2 sample. The compressive performance of BIO2/EG/GO and BIO2/EG increased to 0.11 MPa compared to 0.07 MPa from BIO1. These interesting results proved a new strategy to develop a bio-based flame-retardant RPUF as fire safety thermal insulation materials by incorporating natural-based carbon materials.

In this study, we put our focus on the effect of one important nanoparticle feature - large surface area - to assess eye safety. To this end, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSiNPs) were for the first time employed as a model to evaluate their toxicity in eyes. The porosity of the MSiNPs endows them with a large surface area and the ability to attach to surrounding chemical or biological molecules, further enhancing their surface reactivity and toxic effects. Therefore, to better mimic MSiNP exposure in real environments, we also introduced other hazardous substances such as silver ions (Ag+) to the system and then investigated their synergistic nanotoxicity. Our results showed that the exposure to MSiNPs-Ag(+)and even Ag(+)at a safe dose, resulted in more significant toxicity than the MSiNPs alone, as evidenced from cell viability, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and DNA damage experiments. RNA-Sequencing analysis revealed that the mRNA surveillance signalling pathway plays a unique role in regulating MSiNPs-Ag+-induced cytotoxicity. Besides this, severe corneal damage and dry eye were observed in rat models upon exposure to MSiNPs-Ag(+)compared to MSiNPs.

In this study, a novel electrochemical method was proposed based on reduced graphene oxide-ordered mesoporous carbon screen-printed electrode (rGO-OMC/SPE) analysis, allowing sensitivity and reliable determination of phosphate in turbid coastal waters. Combining the good absorption capacity of OMC with the excellent electroconductivity of rGO, the fabricated electrode exhibits improved signal responses, enhanced by up to 43-fold. The platform was evaluated using turbidity interference test with good recovery percentages comprised between 96% and 105% in different phosphate concentration, and salinity interference test between 92% and 105%, respectively.

Herein, the cobalt catalyst was innovatively supported onto activated carbon fibers (ACFs) to construct an outstanding heterogeneous catalyst, Co@ACFs, for PMS activation. RESULTSCo@ACFs could effectively activate PMS to decompose dyes with about 100% removal rate in 35 min. Co@ACFs maintained its catalytic ability without detectable Co leaching during repeated batch experiments. More importantly, the catalyst presented an enhanced decomposition performance over most reported heterogeneous Co catalysts due to the significant role of ACFs: (i) high adsorption capacity in favor of the enhanced catalytic activity; (ii) ACFs as an electron donor to accelerate Co-II/Co-III cycle thereby speeding up degradation. Combining electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) with radical scavengers, it was found that both sulfate and hydroxyl radicals (SO4 center dot-, (OH)-O-center dot) were responsible for the degradation of dyes. Unexpectedly, (OH)-O-center dot was the dominant radical, different from the reported mechanism in typical Co/PMS. CONCLUSIONThis study not only paves the way to further develop highly efficient and green PMS activation processes, but also provides a new practical method for application to wastewater remediation.

In this study, reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide anions and hydroxyl radicals were generated upon visible-light irradiation of soot particles, and the production activity was consistent with the carbonaceous core content, indicating that the atmospheric soot particles can serve as a potential photocatalyst. The increase of oxygen-containing functional groups, environmentally persistent free radicals, oxygenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and the oxidative potential (OP) of soot after irradiation confirmed the occurrence of visible-light-triggered photocatalytic oxidation of the soot itself. The mechanism analyses suggested that the carbonaceous core caused the production of ROS, which subsequently oxidize the extractable organic species on the soot surface. It is oxidized organic extracts that are responsible for the enhancements of the OP, cell mortality, and intracellular ROS generation.

Biochar composites were synthesized by either pre-treating biomass using MnCl2/KMnO4/NaOH (PMBC) or inserting MnOx ultrafine particles after pyrolysis of biomass (AMBC). In complex water environments, the presence of heavy metals may affect the removal of antibiotics. Cu(II) and Cr(VI) were used to study their effect on DOX removal. RESULTS The BC loaded with MnOx exhibited superior adsorption properties for DOX. The adsorption capacity of AMBC and PMBC was approximate to 93 mg/g and 104 mg g(-1), respectively, which was about nine- and ten-fold higher than that of raw BC (11.48 mg g(-1)). The characterization indicated that AMBC and PMBC had better surface structure and more surface functional groups than raw BC. The main mechanisms for DOX adsorption onto PMBC were surface complexation, H-bond, pi-pi interaction and electrostatic interaction. DOX removal by PMBC also involved its degradation effect on DOX. Adsorption experiments were carried out with the influence of pH, ionic strength and background electrolyte. The presence of Cu(II) obviously enhanced the DOX adsorption capability through Cu(II) bridging effect, whereas the presence of Cr(VI) significantly inhibited DOX adsorption through competitive adsorption and electrostatic repulsion. CONCLUSIONS The results suggested that PMBC could be implemented as a cost-effective and environmentally friendly adsorbent for DOX removal from water. Heavy metal ions can obviously enhance or weaken the adsorption ability of PMBC for DOX.

Aluminum oxide and zinc oxide nanoparticles were added to conventional Iraqi diesel to evaluate on the performance and pollution of a diesel engine not equipped with exhaust gas post-treatment equipment. Before the experiments, the fuel was mixed with the nanoparticles in specified quantities (50 ppm and 100 ppm), and samples of the mixtures were subjected to several tests. Measurements of the mixtures' thermophysical properties showed that the density, viscosity, and thermal conductivity of the suspension increased. Stability tests showed that these mixtures remained stable for at least two months indicating the success of the mixing process. The specific fuel consumption decreased and thermal efficiency increased when nanoparticles were added. This effect increased as a function of nanoparticle dose. Carbon monoxide, unburnt hydrocarbons, and all kinds of particulate matters, sulphur dioxide and hydrogen sulphate decreased with nanoparticle addition. NOx has increased because of higher generated temperature inside the combustion chamber as a result for nanoparticles addition.

Hence, metal organic frameworks (MOFs)-derived self-sacrificing template strategy is adopted, to prepare metal oxides double-shelled nanocages (Co3O4/Co3O4 and Co3O4/NiCo2O4 DSNCs) as hierarchical interfacial catalysts for suppressing the releases of smoke and toxic gases. With the addition of 2.0 wt% Co3O4/Co3O4 DSNCs, the peak smoke production rate (PSPR), total smoke production (TSP), peak CO production rate (PCOP) and total CO production (TCOP) are reduced by 15.8%, 46.9%, 36.2% and 49.1%, separately. When 2.0 wt% Co3O4/NiCo2O4 DSNCs is incorporated, the PSPR, TSP, PCOP and TCOP are markedly decreased by 40.8%, 55.5%, 46.6% and 48.5%, respectively. These results strongly corroborate the efficacy of DSNCs in suppressing the emission of smoke and toxic CO gas. Additionally, the values of peak heat release rate are reduced by 15.9% and 28.4%, reflecting the inhibited heat release. Flame retardancy comparison with reported works corroborates the prominent merit of DSNCs in inhibiting the smoke release. The clear evidence for suppressed toxic CO and NO gases releases is also acquired from TG-IR test. Profiting from the well-formed nanoflake-polymer interfaces, the mechanical performance is obviously improved. In short, these designed DSNCs possess great efficacy in smoke as well as toxic gases removal and mechanical enhancement of EP.

In this study, we collected BC (i.e., diesel BC, coal BC and wood BC) from three typica emission sources, and examined their mediation abilities to the oxidation of glutathione (GSH). Results showed that all three BC significantly promoted the GSH oxidation, and the mediation efficiencies were as follows: diesel BC > coal BC > wood BC. In comparison with the water-soluble fraction, the mediation abilities of three BC mainly came from their solid phase fractions. In the coal BC and wood BC systems, the oxidation of GSH was attributed to the catalysis of transition metals in BC. By contrast, the transition metals, phenolic -OH and persistent free radicals in diesel BC were identified as the active sites responsible for the GSH oxidation. In addition, the graphitic surface of diesel BC could synergize with these active sites to accelerate the oxidation of GSH. Under the catalysis of BC, dissolved oxygen was first reduced to ROS ((sic)and H2O2) and then caused the GSH oxidation.

The DNA damaging capacity is of particular importance since damaged genetic material can lead to carcinogenesis. Consequently, reliable and robust in vitro studies assessing ENM genotoxicity are of great value. We utilized two complementary assays based on different measurement principles: (1) comet assay and (2) FADU (fluorimetric detection of alkaline DNA unwinding) assay. Assessing cell viability ruled out false-positive results due to DNA fragmentation during cell death. Potential structure-activity relationships of 10 ENMs were investigated: three silica nanoparticles (SiO2-NP) with varying degrees of porosity, titanium dioxide (TiO2-NP), polystyrene (PS-NP), zinc oxide (ZnO-NP), gold (Au-NP), graphene oxide (GO) and two multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT). SiO2-NPs, TiO2-NP and GO were neither cytotoxic nor genotoxic to Jurkat E6-I cells. Quantitative interference corrections derived from GO results can make the FADU assay a promising screening tool for a variety of ENMs. MWNT merely induced cytotoxicity, while dose- and time-dependent cytotoxicity of PS-NP was accompanied by DNA fragmentation. Hence, PS-NP served to benchmark threshold levels of cytotoxicity at which DNA fragmentation was expected.

Herein, a novel highly efficient biomass-derived flame retardant (EHPP@PA) with different oxidation state phosphorus is prepared via neutralization of phytic acid (PA) and phenylphosphonate-based compound (EHPP). Due to synergistic effect between PA and EHPP, the incorporation of EHPP@PA significantly improves the flame-retardant performances of epoxy resin (EP), bringing about 64% reduction in peak heat release rate (pHRR) and 16% reduction in total heat release (THR). Additionally, EP/EHPP@PA also displays excellent smoke suppression performance, exhibiting 45% reduction in peak CO production (pCOP), 61% reduction in peak smoke release production rate (pSPR), and 21% reduction in total smoke production (TSP). The flame-retardant mechanism of EHPP@PA is further investigated, indicating that EHPP@PA effectively exerts flame-retardant effect in the condensed and gaseous phases during combustion. In the condensed phase, phytic acid facilitates the formation of a protective char shield, while in the gas phase, EHPP releases PO center dot and NO center dot to quench active radicals and inhibits the combustion.;""[Fang, Fang; Shen, Haifeng; Ran, Shiya; Fang, Zhengping] Zhejiang Univ, Ningbo Inst Technol, Lab Polymer Mat & Engn, Ningbo 315100, Peoples R China; [Fang, Fang; Fang, Zhengping] Zhejiang Univ, Dept Polymer Sci & Engn, MOE Key Lab Macromol Synth & Functionalizat, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China; [Huo, Siqi] Wuhan Inst Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hao; Song, Pingan] Univ Southern Queensland, Ctr Future Mat, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia"";""Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University; Wuhan Institute of Technology; University of Southern Queensland"";""Ran, SY (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Ningbo Inst Technol, Lab Polymer Mat & Engn, Ningbo 315100, Peoples R China.;Song, PA (corresponding author), Univ Southern Queensland, Ctr Future Mat, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia."";""ranshiya@nit.zju.edu.cn; pingan.song@usq.edu.au"";""; Song, Pingan/ACK-1706-2022; Huo, Siqi/HSH-0892-2023; Fang, Zhengping/D-6167-2011; Wang, Hao/A-7340-2016"";""Shen, Haifeng/0000-0002-0744-5518; Ran, Shiya/0000-0003-3493-3960; Song, Pingan/0000-0003-1082-652X; Fang, Zhengping/0000-0002-1775-8358; Huo, Siqi/0000-0002-6454-5208"";;;;;30;;;;;;;;;;;;;FEB;2020;17;;;;;;104;108;;10.1016/j.coco.2019.11.011;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coco.2019.11.011;;;;;;;;;;;;;;View Full Record in Web of Science"

In this work, hyperbranched phosphorus-containing polysiloxane functionalized halloysite nanotubes (HBPPSi-HNTs) were synthesized to prepare flame-retarding, mechanically-strong and tough epoxy composites. The tensile and impact strengths of the composites with 5.0phr HBPPSi-HNTs were improved by 23.7 % and 48.8 % respectively compared with the neat epoxy resin. The epoxy composites also exhibited excellent flame-retardancy due to the instantaneous gas -phase and condensed-phase flame retardant behavior of HBPPSi-HNTs. The composite with 10.0phr HBPPSi-HNTs passed UL-94V-0 rating, with an LOI value as high as 42.6 %.

However, biodiesel is known to pose a series of abiotic and biotic corrosion risks to storage tanks. A typical practice (incumbent system) used to protect the tanks from these risks include (i) coating the interior surface of the tank with a solvent-free epoxy (SFE) liner, and (ii) adding a biocide to the tank. Herein, we present a screening-level life-cycle assessment study to compare the environmental performance of a graphene oxide (GO)-epoxy (GOE) liner with the incumbent system. TRACI was used as an impact assessment tool to model the midpoint environmental impacts in ten categories: global warming potential (GWP, kg CO2 eq.); acidification potential (AP, kg SO2 eq.); potential human health damage impacts due to carcinogens (HH-CP, CTUh) and non-carcinogens (HH-NCP, CTUh); potential respiratory effects (REP, kg PM2.5 eq.); eutrophication potential (EP, kg N eq.); ozone depletion potential (ODP kg CFC-11 eq.); ecotoxicity potential (ETXP, CTUe); smog formation potential (SFP kg O-3 eq.) and fossil fuel depletion potential (FFDP MJ surplus). The equivalent functional unit of the LCA study was designed to protect 30 m(2) of the interior surface (unalloyed steel sheet) of a 10 000 liter biodiesel tank against abiotic and biotic corrosion during its service life of 20 years. Overall, this LCA study highlights the improved environmental performance for the GOE liner compared to the incumbent system, whereby the GOE liner showed 91% lower impacts in ODP impact category, 59% smaller in REP, 62% smaller in AP, 67-69% smaller in GWP and HH-CP, 72-76% smaller in EP, SFP, and FFDP, and 81-83% smaller ETXP and HH-NCP category results. The scenario analysis study revealed that these potential impacts change by less than 15% when the GOE liners are functionalized with silanized-GO nanosheets or GO-reinforced polyvinyl carbazole to improve the antimicrobial properties. The results from an uncertainty analysis indicated that the impacts for the incumbent system were more sensitive to changes in the key modeling parameters compared to that for the GOE liner system."";""[Chilkoor, Govinda; Gadhamshetty, Venkataramana] South Dakota Sch Mines & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 501 E St Joseph St, Rapid City, SD 57701 USA; [Upadhyayula, Venkata K.

GRMs have widely varying effects on plants and, according to recent evidences, graphene oxide (GO) has the potential to interfere with the sexual reproduction owing to its acidic properties and production residues. Here, stigmas of the model plant Cucurbita pepo (summer squash) were subjected to simulated dry depositions of GO and GO purified from production residues (PGO). Stigmas were then hand-pollinated and GRM deposition was checked by ESEM and confocal microscopy. Analysis of stigma integrity, pH homeostasis and pollen-stigma interactions did not reveal negative effects. Fruit and seed production were not affected, but GO depositions of 22.1 +/- 7.2 ng mm-2 affected the normal development of seeds, decreasing seed dimensions, seed germination and germination speed. The elemental analysis revealed that GO has significant quantities of production residues, such as strong acids and oxidants, while PGO has only traces, which justifies the differences observed in the effects caused by the two materials. Our results show that GO depositions of up to 11.1 +/- 3.6 ng mm-2, which fall within the variation range of total dry particulate matter depositions reported in the literature, are safe for reproduction of C. pepo. This is the first safety limit ever recorded for depositions of out-of-the-box GO concerning the reproduction of a seed plant. If confirmed for wind-pollinated species, it might be considered for policymaking of GRMs emis-sions in the air.;""[Zanelli, Davide; Carniel, Fabio Candotto; Tretiach, Mauro] Univ Trieste, Dept Life Sci, I-34127 Trieste, Italy; [Fortuna, Lorenzo] Univ Trieste, Dept Engn & Architecture, I-34127 Trieste, Italy; [Pavoni, Elena] Univ Trieste, Dept Math & Geosci, I-34128 Trieste, Italy; [Gonzalez, Viviana Jehova; Vazquez, Ester] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Inst Reg Invest Cient Aplicada IRICA, Dept Organ Chem, Ciudad Real 13071, Spain; [Vazquez, Ester] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol Quim, Dept Organ Chem, Ciudad Real 13071, Spain; [Prato, Maurizio] Univ Trieste, Dept Chem & Pharmaceut Sci, I-34127 Trieste, Italy; [Prato, Maurizio] Basque Res & Technol Alliance BRTA, Ctr Cooperat Res Biomat CIC BiomaGUNE, Paseo Miramon 194, Donostia San Sebastian 20014, Spain; [Prato, Maurizio] IKERBASQUE, Basque Fdn Sci, Bilbao 48013, Spain"";""University of Trieste; University of Trieste; University of Trieste; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; University of Trieste; CIC biomaGUNE; Basque Foundation for Science"";Carniel, FC (corresponding author), Via L Giorgieri 10, I-34127 Trieste, Italy.;fcandotto@units.it;""; vazquez, ester/K-2244-2014; Vazquez, Ester/K-2244-2014; Carniel, Fabio/N-8115-2019; Gonzlez, Viviana/AAU-4963-2020"";""Pavoni, Elena/0000-0002-9468-7354; Gonzalez Velazquez, Viviana Jehova/0000-0002-8565-0197; Vazquez, Ester/0000-0003-3223-8024;"";;;;;74;;;;;;;;;;;;;JAN;2023;312;;1;;;;;;137138;10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.137138;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.137138;;NOV 2022;;;;;;;;;;;;View Full Record in Web of Science"

While the effects of perinatal air pollution exposure have been investigated, elucidation of outcomes associated with nanomaterial exposure, the focus of this review, is still in its infancy. As the potential uses of nanomaterials, and therefore exposures, increase exponentially so does the need for thorough evaluation. Up to this point, the majority of research in the field of cardiovascular nanotoxicology has focused on the coronary and vascular reactions to pulmonary exposures in young adult, healthy, male models; however, as intentional and unintentional contacts persist, the non-pulmonary risks to under-represented populations become a critical concern. Development of the maternal-fetal circulation during successful mammalian gestation is one of the most unusual complex, dynamic, and acutely demanding physiological systems. Fetal development in a hostile gestational environment can lead to systemic alterations, which may encourage adult disease. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to highlight the few knowns associated with gestational engineered nanomaterial exposure segmented by physiological periods of development or systemic targets: preconception and maternal, gestational, fetal and progeny (Abstract figure). Overall, the limited studies currently available provide compelling evidence of maternal, fetal and offspring dysfunctions after engineered nanomaterial exposure. Understanding the mechanisms associated with these multigenerational effects may allow pregnant women to safely reap the benefits of nanotechnology-enabled products and assist in the implementation of exposure controls to protect the mother and fetus allowing for development of safety by design for engineered nanomaterials."";""[Stapleton, P.

Air filtration has been a widely used and effective method for air purification. However, the addition of antimicrobial agents usually leads to the agglomeration and the toxicity of the filter material. Here, a versatile poly (aryl sulfide sulfone)/graphene oxide@silver (PASS/GO@Ag) air filtration membrane was fabricated by in-situ reduction and electrospinning approach, resulting in high filtration efficiency and excellent biocompatibility. The results showed that GO@Ag antimicrobial agent was successfully synthetized. The Ag nanoparticles (NPs) on the GO surface not only increased the antimicrobial property but also reduced the agglomeration of the antimicrobial agent. Meanwhile, GO@Ag was wrapped on the surface of the PASS nanofibers by ultrasonication to form a rough surface to further improve the filtration ef-ficiency. The as-prepared PASS/GO@Ag membrane exhibited high air filtration performance (99.63 +/- 0.34 %, 79.17 +/- 1.07 Pa). Besides, it also showed excellent antimicrobial properties and good biocompatibility. The antibacterial rates of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) were 99.57 +/- 1.04 % and 97.93 +/- 1.31 %, respectively. More importantly, the PASS/GO@Ag membrane could endow long-term use for one month, with the antibacterial rates of E. coli and S. aureus of 96.52 +/- 1.20 % and 94.48 +/- 1.13 %, respectively.

The satisfactory flame retardancy and smoke suppression were due to the introduction of PMBZ, which could function both in condensed and gas phases through forming a compact and coherence self-extinguishing char layer and inducing a dilution effect. More importantly, the tensile strength, impact strength and flexural strength had also increased by 33.0 %, 53.7 % and 20.7 %, respectively, which indicated the incorporation of PMBZ could also maintain its desired mechanical properties due to the excellent compatibility and enhanced intermolecular interactions.

While several studies have highlighted the high reactivity of soot due to the presence of oxygenated groups on it, some studies conclude that the presence of oxygenated groups on soot may not affect its reactivity. In this work, to be able to exclusively study the effect of oxygenated functional groups on soot and its reactivity, a model compound, graphite, is first partially oxidized through a simplified Torr method using KMnO 4 as an oxidizing agent to introduce oxygenated groups on it. The concentration of oxidizing agent is controlled to ensure the formation of partiallyoxidized-graphite-oxides (POGO) without any significant changes in the structural characteristics so as to determine only the effect of oxygenated groups on oxidation. The POGO materials are then characterized using various techniques such as XRD for crystallite size, FTIR and EDX for oxygenated functional groups, SEM for surface morphological changes, and TGA for their weight-loss profiles during combustion in air. The results indicate a reduction in the activation energy for oxidation with the addition of oxygenated groups on the model soots (POGO), though, after the loss of such groups during oxidation, the activation energies of all the models were close to each other. This indicates that oxygenated groups on soot surface may enhance soot reactivity at low conversion level, but may not have a long-lasting effect on soot oxidation to affect its overall reactivity.

Various characterizations identified the quasi-sphere-on-sphere microstructure of APP@MCM-41 with sustained thermal stability. The addition of APP@MCM-41 into EP matrix gave rise to a featured dispersion with MCM-41 preferentially located at EP/APP interface. The fire evaluation revealed that compared with pristine APP (UL-94 V-1), 9wt% APP@MCM-41 imparted EP matrix with UL-94 V-0 rating. The interfacial aggregate at the interface of EP/APP (7wt%) drove the reduction of peak heat release rate (pHRR) and total smoke production (TSP) by 30.6% and 22.2% respectively. The mechanism investigation via contrastive experiments verified that the interfacial location of MCM-41 remarkably optimized the intumescent cellular structure through the promoted catalytic charring reaction.

In addition, EP/ APP@MCM-41 presented an improved mechanical performance relative to its counterparts due to an enhanced matrix-filler adhesion.

In this work, phosphorus and nitrogen co-doped rGO (PN-rGO), synthesized using a scalable hydrothermal and microwave process, was used as an additive to improve the flame retardancy of epoxy resin (EP) for the first time. Chemical structure and morphology characterization confirmed that the nitrogen and phosphorus atoms were doped into the graphite lattice adopting pyrrolic-N, pyridinic-N, quaternary-N and pyrophosphate and metaphosphate forms. Doping increased the oxidization resistance of rGO and the thermal-oxidative stability of its composites' char, while also improving the catalytic charring ability of polymer. Both effects resulted in the formation of a stable char protective layer during burning and to a significant improvement in flame retardation and smoke suppression in the final composites. The peak heat release rate (PHRR), total heat release (THR) and total smoke production (TSP) for the EP-based composite (containing 5 wt% PN-rGO) decreased by 30.9%, 29.3% and 51.3%, respectively, compared to neat EP. Our work has produced a promising graphene-based flame retardant additive for the mass production of high-performance composites, also expended the application of heteroatom-doped graphene.

In the present study, we studied the potential of an Fe3O4-modified wood-based biochar (FDBC) composite to remove an aqueous anionic dye, bromophenol blue (BPB) via simple magnets. Smaller surface area (1.5 times) and a smaller pore volume (similar to 2 times) of FDBC over the original biochar (DBC) does not impede the BPB uptake by FDBC. The Langmuir monolayer BPB adsorption capacities of FDBC and DBC are 448.0 and 451.0 mg/g (removal percentages, 89.8 % vs. 90.3 %) (adsorbent dose 50 mg, 25 mL of 1000 mg/L BPB concentration, 2 h, pH 5.0). The larger surface area (248 m(2)/g) and abundant nano Fe3O4 (11.0 nm) sites account for FDBC's excellent BPB removal compared to recent IONPs-based adsorbents. At pH 5.0-8.0, the BPB is bound to the FDBC (points of zero charge = 8.2) via H-bonding and pi-pi stacking, as confirmed by pH, desorption, and thermodynamic studies. Compared to NaOH and H2O2, methanol desorbs more BPB from the spent adsorbent at pH 7.0. Moreover, this composite removes even the BPB residuals from real wastewater, becoming an ideal adsorbent for BPB removal. A limited life cycle assessment of FDBC's synthesis revealed a higher impact for global warming (2.38 kg CO(2)eq) per kg of the adsorbent, whereas the lower impacts for ozone depletion, particulate matter emissions, and air quality. The FDBC is more economical because of its green and facile synthesis, excellent dye removal capacity, easy and fast recovery. Efficient multiple dye uptake of FDBC produces large concentration of recovered dyes, which can be possibly reused in various economic applications.;""[Samaraweera, Hasara; Nawalage, Samadhi; Mlsna, Todd] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Chem, Starkville, MS 39762 USA; [Samaraweera, Hasara] Univ Arkansas, Dept Chem & Biochem, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Alam, Shah Saud] Univ Kansas, Dept Mech Engn, Lawrence, KS 66047 USA; [Parashar, Dinkar] Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Civil Engn, Environm Engn Div, Chennai 600036, Tamil Nadu, India; [Khan, Afzal Husain] Jazan Univ, Coll Engn, Civil Engn Dept, Jazan, Saudi Arabia; [Chui, Iwei] Mississippi State Univ, Inst Imaging & Analyt Technol, Starkville, MS 39762 USA; [Perez, Felio] Univ Memphis, Integrated Microscopy Ctr, Mat Sci Lab, Memphis, TN 38152 USA; [Samaraweera, Hasara] Univ Arkansas, Chem Bldg, Fayetteville, AR 72703 USA"";""Mississippi State University; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; University of Kansas; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras; Jazan University; Mississippi State University; University of Memphis; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville"";Samaraweera, H (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas, Chem Bldg, Fayetteville, AR 72703 USA.;ds099@uark.edu;""Khan, Afzal/AAV-3168-2020; Samaraweera, Hasara/ABE-8597-2021; Perez, Felio/GLN-3393-2022; Khan, Afzal Husain/AAV-3168-2020"";""Mlsna, Todd/0000-0002-4858-1372; Khan, Afzal Husain/0000-0001-8883-9019"";;;;;50;;;;;;;;;;;;;DEC;2023;56;;;;;;;;104377;10.1016/j.jwpe.2023.104377;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jwpe.2023.104377;;OCT 2023;;;;;;;;;;;;View Full Record in Web of Science"

In this study, we investigated the influence of pre-incubation with bovine serum albumin (BSA) on internalization, cytotoxicity, oxidative stress and inflammation induced by pristine/carboxylated MWCNTs to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) indicated the adsorption of proteins onto the surface of MWCNTs, which consequently increased the diameter. Pre-incubation with BSA did not obviously influence the hydrodynamic sizes, but decreased the zeta potential of MWCNTs. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated the internalization of both types of MWCNTs into HUVECs, whereas pre-incubation with BSA appeared to enhance the internalization. MWCNT exposure induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress, as well as a modest inflammatory response shown as an increased THP-1 adhesion to HUVECs, but not release of interleukin 6 (IL-6) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF alpha). Exposure to MWCNTs pre-incubated with BSA induced less cytotoxicity to HUVECs, associated with increased intracellular glutathione (GSH). However, MWCNTs induced IL-6 and TNF alpha, release, as well as THP-1 adhesion to HUVECs, were enhanced after pre-incubation with BSA. In summary, these data indicated that pre-incubation with BSA could enhance the internalization of MWCNTs to HUVECs, which consequently reduces the cytotoxicity and oxidative stress, but enhances the inflammatory response of MWCNTs. The reduced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress, and enhanced inflammatory responses are likely due to a combined effect of BSA and MWCNTs, which suggests that when assessing the biological effects of MWCNTs in circulation, it is necessary to consider the interactions between MWCNTs and serum proteins.;""[Long, Jimin; Kang, Yang; Gu, Zhipeng] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Engn, Key Lab Sensing Technol & Biomed Instrument Guang, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Long, Jimin; Ding, Yanhuai; Cao, Yi] Xiangtan Univ, Coll Chem, Key Lab Environm Friendly Chem & Applicat, Lab Biochem,Minist Educ, Xiangtan 411105, Peoples R China; [Long, Jimin; Li, Xianqiang] Tarim Univ, Coll Anim Sci, Key Lab Tarim Anim Husb Sci & Technol Xinjiang Pr, Alar 843300, Peoples R China"";""Sun Yat Sen University; Xiangtan University; Tarim University"";""Gu, ZP (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Engn, Key Lab Sensing Technol & Biomed Instrument Guang, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Ding, YH (corresponding author), Xiangtan Univ, Coll Chem, Key Lab Environm Friendly Chem & Applicat, Lab Biochem,Minist Educ, Xiangtan 411105, Peoples R China."";""yhding@xtu.edu.cn; guzhp@mail.sysu.edu.cn"";""Gu, Zhi peng/E-5108-2013; cao, yi/LFV-6611-2024; Ding, Yan-Huai/AAB-9084-2022; Gu, Zhipeng/E-5108-2013"";""Gu, Zhi peng/0000-0003-4533-6539; Kang, Yang/0000-0003-4580-9316; Ding, Yan-Huai/0000-0003-1176-6397;"";;;;;46;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2018;8;17;;;;;9253;9260;;10.1039/c8ra00445e;http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra00445e;;;;;;;;;;;;;;View Full Record in Web of Science"

Air pollution, primarily due to increased levels of H2S, SOx, NH3, NOx, CO, volatile organic compounds (VOC), and particulate matter (PM) in the atmosphere, has a significant impact on public health, and exhaust gases harm the natural sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon cycles. Similarly, wastewater discharged to the environment with metal ions, herbicides, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, dyes, and aromatics/organic compounds is a risk for health since it may lead to an outbreak of waterborne pathogens and increase the exposure to endocrine-disrupting agents. Therefore, developing new and efficient air and water quality management systems is critical. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are novel materials for which the main application areas include gas storage and separation, water harvesting from the atmosphere, chemical sensing, power storage, drug delivery, and food preservation. Due to their versatile structural motifs that can be modified during synthesis, MOFs also have a great promise for green applications including air and water pollution remediation. The motivation to use MOFs for environmental applications prompted the modification of their structures via the addition of metal and functional groups, as well as the creation of heterostructures by mixing MOFs with other nanomaterials, to effectively remove haz-ardous contaminants from wastewater and the atmosphere. In this review, we focus on the state-of-the-art environmental applications of MOFs, particularly for water treatment and air pollution, by highlighting the groundbreaking studies in which MOFs have been used as adsorbents, membranes, and photocatalysts for the abatement of air and water pollution.

Due to the large volume of generated wastewater, complex composition including catalysts, aromatics and various oxygen-containing compounds, and serious environmental hazard, wastewater recycling is critical for sustainable industrial development and ecological protection. Herein, a swirl regenerating micro-channel separation (SRMS) technology was proposed to integrate deep filtration and hydrocyclone-enhanced regeneration. A small-scale experimental investigation was first conducted to verify the feasibility of the MTO wastewater treatment. A pilot SRMS device with a treatment capacity of 20 m(3)/h was constructed, and the device's continuous operation effect and stability were comprehensively evaluated. The separation performance of the SRMS device at different solution pH values and the impact of the hydrocyclone-enhanced regeneration of separation media were discussed in detail. At low solution pH values (<7), the SRMS device exhibits an average separation efficiency of 92.0% for fine particulate matter in wastewater, and the median particle size, d(50), decreases from 1.55 to 0.6 mu m. As the solution pH increases, the repulsive energy barrier for the medium-contaminant and contaminant-contaminant increases, inhibiting the deposition behavior of particulate pollutants. In addition, hydrocyclone desorbs contaminants deposited on the separation media and the average contaminant residual rate decreases from 3.3 to 0.2 wt%. We propose an industrial application for treating and reusing MTO wastewater (200 m(3)/h) using the SRMS technology based on the experimental results. The costs of the wastewater treatment process are as low as 0.25 CNY/m(3), and the wastewater reuse rate is over 97% without chemical consumption.

Previous studies are usually focused on the comprehensive recovery of this dust, however, its wetting, which was an essential procedure in many industrial processes, has long been a challenge due to its strongly hydrophobic property. The current study investigated the origin of its hydrophobicity through wettability tests, dynamic contact angle analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, with the goal of enhancing its wettability. The results revealed for the first time that the hydrophobicity of respirable sintering dust was attributed to a hydrophobic shell consisting of organics with n-alkyl chains and/or aromatic groups and bonding by hydrophilic functional groups. Further, results of response surface methodology with central composite design and dynamic contact angle analysis demonstrated that increasing agitation strength, such as stirring speed and time, can improve the wettability of respirable sintering dust, while the largest wettable ratio of 95.3% was obtained by stirring with 0.2% Triton X-100. Eventually, a possible wetting mechanism was mainly concluded as nonionic surfactants adsorbing with the hydrophobic shell on respirable sintering dust surface via its hydrophobic tail and leaving its hydrophilic head groups exposed to water, achieving sufficiently and efficiently wetting. The adsorption experiments and surface analysis results implied that the adsorption process for Triton X-100 onto respirable sintering dust is favorable and governed by physisorption. This study provides an effective method on the wetting of respirable sintering dust, which is essential for its treatment such as dust control and hydrometallurgy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Curing behavior, flame retardancy and combustion behavior of PA-AEP cured epoxy resin were investigated. By comparison with EP/AEP reference sample, EP/PA-AEP samples showed good flame retardancy and smoke suppression effect because of the addition of PA-AEP. The PA-AEP cured EP sample passed UL-94 V-0 rating and achieved to a limiting oxygen index (LOI) value of 28.0% with 20 wt% PA-AEP. Cone calorimeter test results showed that, compared with EP/20% AEP reference sample, both the peak of heat release rate (PHRR), total heat release (THR), the peak of smoke production release (SPR) and total smoke production (TSP) of EP/20 wt% PA-AEP sample were decreased by 44.4%, 55%, 49% and 80.8%, respectively. In addition, by analyzing the char residues and volatile pyrolysis products, it was concluded that PA-AEP mainly played an important role in condensed phase which was associated with the formation of phosphorus-rich intumescent char layer.

To overcome this obstacle, a double core-shell structured zeolite imidazole framework-8 (ZIF-8) in combination with negatively charged phytic acid and positively charged hyperbranched polysiloxane (NH2-HBPSi) was layer -by-layer self-assembled through the electrostatic method. The decorated NH2-HBPSi layer effectively improved the interfacial compatibility between the fillers and the TPU matrix. The peak heat release rate (PHRR), total heat release (THR), total smoke production (TSP), and total CO production (TCOP) of the TPU composite containing 2.0 wt% ZIF-8@PA@NH2-HBPSi were reduced by 35.2%, 25.2%, 65.5%, and 52.8%, respectively, as compared to those of pure TPU. The distinguished fire resistance and smoke suppression were ascribed to the flame retardant effects of Zn, N, P, and Si elements in the ZIF-8@PA@NH2-HBPSi hybrid. In addition, the TPU/ZIF-8@PA@NH2-HBPSi composite maintained a high elongation at break of 2178.2% and tensile strength of 46.87 MPa due to the steric effect of NH2-HBPSi.

CuMoO4 was then introduced onto the surface of RGO-LDH to prepare a hybrid with CuMoO4 modified RGO-LDH (RGO-LDH/CuMoO4). The composition, structure and morphology of RGO-LDH/CuMoO4 were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Laser raman spectroscopy and Transmission electron microscope-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. It was found that the hybrid of RGO-LDH/CuMoO4 had been successfully prepared. The effects of flame retardancy and smoke suppression of epoxy resin were studied with added RGO-LDH/CuMoO4. Results showed that the PHRR and THR of the EP composite with RGO-LDH/CuMoO4 added were decreased dramatically. The char yield, LOI and UL-94 vertical burning rating of the EP composite were increased, with improved flame ratardancy. In addition, the SPR, TSP, and D-s,D-max of the EP composite were decreased drastically with added RGO-LDH/CuMoO4. Its improved flame retardancy and smoke suppression performance were due mainly to the physical barrier of graphene and LDH, and the catalytic carbonization function of LDH. Meanwhile, Cu2O and MoO3 generated from RGO-LDH/CuMoO4 in the combustion process helped enhance the production of char residue and raised the compactness of the char layer. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, a biobased durable, reusable and highly sensitive fire warning composite (CTM) was developed using casein as the film-forming agent and dopant, MXene (Ti3C2Tx) as the conductive skeleton, and tannic acid as the crosslinking agent and free radical scavenger. Notably, the resultant CTM composite exhibits mechanically flexible properties, excellent thermal stability (T10% of 239.6 degrees C) and superb fire safety (total heat release (THR), total smoke production (TSP) and CO production rate of sensor are only 1.35 MJ/m2, 0.19 m2 and 0.42 mg/s, respectively). More importantly, the CTM presents reliable and rapid cycle warning responses under both direct flame attack and non-contact fire threat. Under continuous exposure to flame, it demonstrates an ultra-fast response time (982 ms), a long-time stable alert (93 s), and a repeatable warning ability. Under the impact of repetitively approaching flame, it exhibits consistent distance-dependent changes in resistance within 3 s, affording attractive accessibility to detect flame position.

As a new type of a highly effective flame retardant, black phosphorus (BP) can effectively decrease the thermal hazard of polymers, but its performances in smoke suppression and toxicity reduction are unsatisfactory. In this article, a method of covalently grafting diazotized BP with a ferrocene oligomer was applied to promote the smoke suppression and toxicity reduction efficiency of BP. In our work, the BP-NH nanomaterials with a mass of amino groups on the surface were acquired by diazotizing the BP. Then, the BP-Fe was obtained by covalently grafting the ferrocene chloride salt and nitrogen-containing heterocycles on the surface of BP. The smoke production rate (SPR) and total smoke production (TSP) values of the epoxy resin (EP) decreased by 49.8% and 52.5% with the addition of 2 wt% BP-Fe, respectively. In comparison with previous studies, this work was far more effective than the previous work in smoke suppression and flame retardant. The release of toxic gases (CO and HCN) and volatile organic compounds in the EP was also effectively inhibited at the same time. In addition, the storage modulus and tensile strength of nanocomposites increased by 35.1% and 27.2% with the addition of 1 wt% BP-Fe.

The targeted assembly of nanomaterials to optimize the flame retardancy, mechanical properties, and interfacial properties of composite materials is a prominent research hotspot in the field of EP. Therefore, a hierarchical sea-urchin inspired architecture (NiPS@LDH), based on layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets grown on nickel phyllosilicate (NiPS), was rationally constructed as a functional filler for EP with a view to building high-performance EP composites. The addition of 1 wt% NiPS@LDH increased the tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, and elongation at break of EP by 44.1 %, 27.6 %, and 66.2 %, respectively, showing excellent strengthening and toughening effects. Meanwhile, under dry friction conditions, the wear rate of the composites was 0.86 mm3 center dot N- 1 center dot m- 1, reduced by 87.8 % compared to that of pure EP, indicating excellent wear resistance.

Here, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) was simultaneously exfoliated and flame-retardant functionalized into BNNS via one-step ball milling process based on the synergetic effect of mechanical shear and chemical peeling of ammonium phosphate and sodium hydroxide. Then the epoxy (EP)-based composites containing hBN or BNNS were prepared by solution blending and program-controlled curing. The possible mechanochemical reaction mechanisms were proposed according to the incorporation of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and chemical structure characteristics. As one of potential applications, the obtained flame-retardant functionalized BNNS (BNNS1 and BNNS2) were used as multifunctional additives for fabricating high-performance EP-based thermal conductive composites with excellent flame retardancy. As expected, the obtained EP-based composites containing only 5 wt % BNNS exhibited a superior flame retardancy with a dramatic decrease in the values of peak heat release rate (PHRR), the total heat release (THR), the smoke production rate (SPR) and the total smoke production (TSP) corresponding to 60.9%, 35.7%, 44.3% and 38.8% reductions, respectively, compared to neat EP. The dramatical enhancement in flame retardancy was mainly attributed to the catalytic charring effect and physical barrier action of flame-retardant functionalized BNNS, led to the formation of a compact and robust char layer during combustion to protect the underlying polymer. Simultaneously, due to uniform dispersion and strong interfacial adhesion, the incorporation of BNNS not only increased the thermal conduction paths by increasing specific surface area, but also reduced the interfacial thermal resistance (R-b) caused by phonon scattering, leading to an enhancement (312.4% and 397.0%) in the TC of EP/BNNS composites at 30 wt% BNNSi and BNNS2, respectively.;""[Han, Gaojie; Feng, Yuezhan; Liu, Chuntai] Zhengzhou Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Adv Polymer Proc Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Mat Proc & Mold, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Xiaoyu; Xie, Xiaolin] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, Minist Educ, Key Lab Mat Chem Energy Convers & Storage, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Ma, Jianmin] Hunan Univ, Sch Phys & Elect, Key Lab Micro Nanooptoelect Devices, Minist Educ, Changsha 410022, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Keqing] China Univ Geosci Wuhan, Fac Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Shi, Yongqian] Fuzhou Univ, Coll Environm & Resources, Fuzhou 350116, Peoples R China; [Liu, Chuntai] Hangzhou Ebei Ind Co Ltd, Hangzhou 311500, Peoples R China"";""Zhengzhou University; Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Hunan University; China University of Geosciences; Fuzhou University"";""Feng, YZ; Liu, CT (corresponding author), Zhengzhou Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Adv Polymer Proc Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Mat Proc & Mold, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China."";""yzfeng@zzu.edu.cn; ctliu@zzu.edu.cn"";""; Liu, Chun-Tai/E-7559-2016; Shi, Yongqian/P-2454-2019; Xie, Xiaolin/H-4993-2014; Ma, Jianmin/M-5217-2013; Feng, Yuezhan/JOZ-4614-2023; Zhao, Xiaoyu/F-3728-2015"";""Ma, Jianmin/0000-0003-2081-2877; Shi, Yongqian/0000-0002-5646-4627;"";;;;;61;;;;;;;;;;;;;MAR 1;2021;407;;;;;;;;127099;10.1016/j.cej.2020.127099;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2020.127099;;;;;;;;;;;;;;View Full Record in Web of Science"

Graphene, a two-dimensional-layered material with physical barrier effects, is used by many researchers to enhance the fire safety of EP, but because of its easy aggregation, it is difficult to prepare high-performance flame retardants. In our work, a high-performance graphene flame retardant was prepared by grafting a hollow zirconium organic frame material onto the surface of graphene. First, zirconium-based organic frame material (UiO66-NH2) with different particle sizes was prepared by adjusting acetic acid, the hollow organic frame material was etched with sodium tungstate under acidic conditions, and then reacted with organophosphorus and graphene oxide, thus W-UiO66-DOPO-RGO were obtained.

However, the contribution of conventional flame retardants to the volume increase is largely negligible. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), as a bio-based macromolecule, contains both acidsource, carbon source and gas source groups in its structure, which determines the ability of these groups to synergistically promote the formation of swollen residual carbon at high temperatures, resulting in a good flame retardant effect. Here, a novel and highly efficient organic-inorganic composite flame retardant was achieved by coupling ATP with BN using polydopamine (PDA) as a medium and anchoring Cu-MOF nanoparticles uniformly on its surface. Among them, the high barrier of BN imparted the EP resin and residual carbon excellent heat shielding properties, the presence of ATP facilitated the formation of expanded carbon slag. Besides, the metal ions in Cu-MOF promote the conversion of more cracking products to residual carbon, while the microporous structure of MOF has an appreciable adsorption effect on the flue gas. The results showed that compared to EP, the THR and PHRR for BN/PATP@CuMOF/EP decreased by 32.0% and 41.3%, separately. Moreover, the PSRP, TSP, PCOPR and PCO2PR values of BN/PATP@Cu-MOF/EP were visibly lower than those of other specimens, decreasing to 0.226 m2/s, 20.43 m2/s, 0.081% and 0.73%, accordingly, justifying its most optimal fume suppression effect. According to the condensed phase and gas phase flame retardant principle, the synergism of BN, ATP and Cu-MOF leading to the construction of an expanded coal network having greater strength and barrier properties, which is the key to reduce heat release and smoke generation.

Therefore a novel g-C3N4@PPZ hierarchical architecture constituted of porous g-C(3)N4 tubes modified by polyphosphazene was designed and fabricated to improve the fire safety and mechanical properties of BMI in this work. Especially compared to pure BMI, the peak heat release rate (PHRR) and peak smoke production rate (PSPR) of BMI with an incorporation of 2 wt% g-C3N4@PPZ (BMI/g-C3N4@PPZ2.0) are at 246.3 kW/m(2) and 0.12 m(2)/s accompanying with 52.1% and 53.8% reduction respectively.

However, the underpinned fundamental mechanics theory that addresses large deformation, severe instability and self-assembly of 2D sheets under dynamic solid-liquid interactions during liquid evaporation is lacking. In the present study, we propose a theoretical mechanics framework to quantitatively describe the simultaneous process of crumpling and self-assembling of 2D materials and their competition during droplet evaporation. In this theory, a rotational spring is developed to describe the out-of-plane deformation of crumpling sheets, and a mechanical slider is implemented to describe the interactive binding energy in self-folding of a single sheet or overlapping of neighboring sheets. The spring-slider mechanics model is calibrated with the energy-based continuum mechanics analysis by crumpling a single sheet, and is further extended to a network model to characterize the crumpling and assembling of multiple sheets in the droplet. An equivalent pressure model is developed to unify the resultant forces associated with liquid evaporation including capillary force, vapor pressure, gas pressure, vapor recoil pressure and capillary flow-induced force. A coarse-grained model of 2D materials is developed and its dynamic interaction with liquid molecules during evaporation is mimicked by proposing a controllable virtual van der Waal force field. Molecular dynamics simulation results show remarkable agreement with theoretical predictions, from crumpling and assembling energies of graphene during liquid evaporation to overall size and accessible area of the crumpled particles after the complete evaporation of liquid. Besides, both theoretical predictions and simulation results agree well with independent experiments. The effect of concentration, size, shape, number and size distribution of 2D material graphene sheets in liquid droplets on crumpling and self-assembling energy and shape, size and surface morphology of crumpled particles is also discussed. The mechanics theories and coarse-grained modeling established here are expected to offer immediate and quantitative application guidance to control the crumpling and self-assembling process of 2D materials by liquid solution evaporation processing to fine tune particle size and morphology. More importantly, the fundamental understanding of large deformation, instability, and self-assembly of 2D materials in such dynamic liquid environments could be extended to aerosol-like processing of a broad scope of other low-dimensional nanomaterials such as lipid membranes, nanowires, nanotubes, nanofibers and nanoparticles, for their emerging applications including ultrafine particle manufacturing and various printing processes.

Herein, we reported the functionalized design and online formation of epoxy resin (EP) multi-hierarchical char layer with improved mass and heat barrier performance under fire environment using oxidized microcrystalline cellulose (OMCC) as het-erogeneous char-forming agent (HCA). The morphologies and components evolution of char layers of EP -intumescent flame retardants (IFRs) via roasting at different temperature were characterized. Strikingly, when the content of HCA was 5%, EP with microencapsulated ammonium polyphosphate (MFAPP) (3.75%) could achieve continue and compact outer surface char layer, formed the honeycomb-like char cells in the inner layer and served as the supporting effect for highly expanded char layer. Noteworthy, this multi-hierarchical char layers of EP-IFRs declined the heat spreading, its outer surface temperature stabilized at 42 degrees C when placed on 240 degrees C hot plate. Self-designed device combustion test showed this EP-IFRs could obtain the self-extinguished property within 2 min and high residue (96.3%).

However, the shortcoming of instability and re-agglomeration enables great challenges toward its application. Herein, a lanthanide metal ligand ((CF3SO3)(3) Er) has been employed to decorate few-layer BP nanosheets. By means of density functional theory (DFT), there is a high adsorption energy of -1.49 eV in the system, which confirms a powerful adsorbing effect is existed between BP and (CF3SO3)(3) Er. Due to the charge transfer from BP to (CF3SO3)(3) Er molecule, the lone-pair electrons of BP are passivated, thereby the decorated BP (Er-BP) exhibits robust stability in ambient conditions and common solvents. Whereafter, the Er-BP is loading into epoxy resin (EP) to manufacture EP-based composites. The Er-BP can not only effectively enhance the dispersion of BP in EP substrate, but also catalyze the curing process of EP nanocomposites. When the amount of Er-BP in epoxy is 3.0 wt%, the residual char content is clearly improved by 75.42%, which is attributed to the coadjutant catalytic charring function between BP and (CF3SO3)(3) Er. EP/Er-BP 3.0 sample can meet the requirement of UL-94 V-0 testing, and the limiting oxygen index (LOI) value is improved from 24.7% to 30.3%. Meanwhile, there is a 61.37% reduction in the peak heat release rate (PHRR) and a 36.68% decrease in the total heat release (THR). The smoke production rate (SPR) and total smoke production (TSP) are also decreased by 62.90% and 55.94%, respectively. Particularly, the amount of CO released per second (COP) is dramatically reduced by 74.24%, implying that the heat and smoke release has been significantly suppressed due to the production of protective char layer.;""[Qu, Zhencai; Xu, Chang-an; Hu, Zhuorong; Li, Yue; Meng, Huifa; Tan, Zhiyou; Shi, Jun; Wu, Kun] Chinese Acad Sci, Guangzhou Inst Chem, Guangzhou 510650, Peoples R China; [Qu, Zhencai; Xu, Chang-an; Hu, Zhuorong; Li, Yue; Meng, Huifa; Shi, Jun; Wu, Kun] Guangdong Prov Key Lab Organ Polymer Mat Elect, Guangzhou 510650, Peoples R China; [Qu, Zhencai; Xu, Chang-an; Hu, Zhuorong; Li, Yue; Meng, Huifa] CAS Engn Lab Special Fine Chem, Guangzhou 510650, Peoples R China; [Qu, Zhencai; Xu, Chang-an; Hu, Zhuorong; Li, Yue; Meng, Huifa] CASH GCC Nanxiong Res Inst New Mat Co Ltd, Guangzhou 510650, Peoples R China; [Qu, Zhencai; Xu, Chang-an; Hu, Zhuorong; Li, Yue; Meng, Huifa; Tan, Zhiyou] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 10049, Peoples R China"";""Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS"";Wu, K (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Guangzhou Inst Chem, Guangzhou 510650, Peoples R China.;wukun@gic.ac.cn;Xu, Chang-An/AAV-3515-2020;Xu, Chang-An/0000-0002-5718-4088;;;;;58;;;;;;;;;;;;;DEC 1;2020;202;;;;;;;;108440;10.1016/j.compositesb.2020.108440;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesb.2020.108440;;;;;;;;;;;;;;View Full Record in Web of Science"

Carbon nanomaterials added to diesel have been identified as a promising alternative for reducing particulate matter and NOx emissions. However, the stability of the dispersions of these nanomaterials in liquid fuels is an issue of major concern because it determines the applicability of nanofuels to internal combustion engines. That is why some alternatives, like carbon nanomaterial functionalization, have been explored to increase the stability of nanofuels, but the addition of these functionalized nanomaterials could have an effect on the combustion properties of the blends. This work explores for the first time the effect of using amidefunctionalized carbon nanotubes on the ignition delay of blends of these nanomaterials (50 and 100 ppm) and Colombian commercial diesel (90 % petroleum diesel and 10 % palm-oil biodiesel) and palm-oil biodiesel. The characterization of the ignition delay was conducted on a droplet scale through the shadowgraph technique since this property is an indicator of the performance of real compression ignition engines in terms of combustion efficiency and pollutant emissions. Results showed that the addition of carbon nanotubes, either functionalized or not, increased the volumetric expansion of the droplets before ignition by up to 1.6 % in comparison with the raw fuels. Also, the addition of carbon nanotubes reduced the ignition delay of the blends in comparison to the raw fuels by about 18.3 % and 13.1 % for biodiesel with functionalized carbon nanotubes at 50 ppm and 100 ppm, respectively; 9.4 % and 11.8 % for biodiesel with no-functionalized carbon nanotubes at 50 ppm and 100 ppm, respectively; 12.3 % and 18.3 % for commercial diesel with functionalized carbon nanotubes at 50 ppm and 100 ppm, respectively; and 14.9 % and 14.7 % for commercial diesel with no-functionalized carbon nanotubes at 50 ppm and 100 ppm, respectively. However, the reduction for biodiesel with functionalized carbon nanotubes at 100 ppm was not significantly different from that of the biodiesel added with no-functionalized carbon nanotubes at 50 and 100 ppm. In the case of commercial diesel, despite the reduction of the ignition delay for all the nanofuels in comparison with the raw fuel, there was not a significant difference between the functionalized and no-functionalized blends."";""[Renteria, Jorge; Gallego, Anderson; Gamboa, David; Cacua, Karen; Herrera, Bernardo] Inst Tecnol Metropolitano, Grp Adv Mat & Energy, Fac Engn, Medellin, Colombia; [Gallego, Anderson] Inst Univ Pascual Bravo, Fac Engn, Res & Innovat Energy Grp GIIEN, Medellin, Colombia"";;Herrera, B (corresponding author), Inst Tecnol Metropolitano, Grp Adv Mat & Energy, Fac Engn, Medellin, Colombia.;bernardoherrera@itm.edu.co;""; Gallego, Anderson/X-3946-2018; Cacua, Karen/Q-4149-2018; Colorado, David/ABF-2579-2020"";""Gamboa, David/0000-0002-1966-374X; Cacua, Karen/0000-0001-7535-9622; Renteria Pelaez, Jorge Luis/0000-0003-2882-0206;"";;;;;76;;;;;;;;;;;;;APR 15;2023;338;;;;;;;;127202;10.1016/j.fuel.2022.127202;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2022.127202;;DEC 2022;;;;;;;;;;;;View Full Record in Web of Science"

The addition of NitrON(R) reduces the concentration of nitrogen oxides (NOx), due to a reduction in the kinetic combustion rate, at the cost of a slight increase in the concentration of particulate matter (PM) in the engine exhaust gas. The Reduxco(R) additive reduces PM emissions by increasing the diffusion combustion rate, while slightly increasing the NOx concentration in the engine exhaust gas. Research conducted by the authors confirmed that the simultaneous use of both of these additives in the fuel not only reduced both NOx and PM emissions in the exhaust gas but additionally the reduction of NOx and PM emissions was greater than the sum of the effects of these additives-the synergy effect. Findings indicated that the waveforms of the heat release rate (dQ/d alpha) responsible for the emission of NOx and PM in the exhaust gas differed for the four tested fuels in relation to the maximum value (selectively and independently in the kinetic and diffusion stage), and they were also phase shifted. Due to this, the heat release process Q(alpha) was characterized by a lower amount of heat released in the kinetic phase compared to fuel with NitrON(R) only and a greater amount of heat released in the diffusion phase compared to fuel with Reduxco(R) alone, which explained the lowest NOx and PM emissions in the exhaust gas at that time. For example for the NOx concentration in the engine exhaust: the Nitrocet(R) fuel additive (in the used amount of 1500 ppm) reduces the NOx concentration in the exhaust gas by 18% compared to the base fuel. The addition of a Reduxco(R) catalyst to the fuel (1500 ppm) unfortunately increases the NOx concentration by up to 20%. On the other hand, the combustion of the complete tested fuel, containing both additives simultaneously, is characterized, thanks to the synergy effect, by the lowest NOx concentration (reduction by 22% in relation to the base). For example for PM emissions: the Nitrocet(R) fuel additive does not significantly affect the PM emissions in the engine exhaust (up to a few per cent compared to the base fuel). The addition of a Reduxco(R) catalyst to the fuel greatly reduces PM emissions in the engine exhaust, up to 35% compared to the base fuel. On the other hand, the combustion of the complete tested fuel containing both additives simultaneously is characterized by the synergy effect with the lowest PM emission (reduction of 39% compared to the base fuel).;""[Cisek, Jerzy; Lesniak, Szymon] Cracow Univ Technol, Fac Mech Engn, PL-31571 Krakow, Poland; [Stanik, Winicjusz] Natl Res Inst, Oil & Gas Inst, PL-31503 Krakow, Poland; [Przybylski, Wlodzimierz] Dagas Sp Zoo, PL-05660 Warka, Poland"";""Cracow University of Technology; Oil & Gas Institute - National Research Institute"";Cisek, J (corresponding author), Cracow Univ Technol, Fac Mech Engn, PL-31571 Krakow, Poland.;""jcisek@pk.edu.pl; szymon.lesniak@doktorant.pk.edu.pl; stanik@inig.pl; wlodzimierz.przybylski@dagas.pl"";;Stanik, Winicjusz/0000-0002-4138-4886;;;;;46;;;;;;;;;;;;;MAY;2021;14;10;;;;;;;2784;10.3390/en14102784;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14102784;;;;;;;;;;;;;;View Full Record in Web of Science"
